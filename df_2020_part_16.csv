Publix is great for short term, it's only good for long-term if you have nothing in your life to do and never went to college.","Management is half and half. At least at my store they give great hours but for how much work I do, I only get paid $10.50. 

I also was told I was getting promoted to get paid more, but that hasn't reflected in my Publix org profile for 3 weeks now. I've been working at Publix since COVID started and haven't gotten one evaluation yet either to get promoted even further.

If you have employees not pushing their own weight, they won't let them go. Especially in a smaller store, they need all the help they can get.

Publix takes pride in ""Intolerant of waste"" although each night tons of waste gets trashed. People who didn't buy the extra chicken they made or the hundreds of donuts. Publix should be donating this food to food banks each night instead of tossing it. That's if they really have these core values in place.

1 of our full time front end employees hasn't been to work for like 5 months and they don't want to let her go and give her benefits to someone else. Speaking of full time, an employee in the Deli who worked at Publix for only 3 months got full time even though he's horrible at his job. Nice management.

3.0,"Good workplace, but the company couldn't care less about you","Former Employee, more than 1 year","The company is relatively professional in its interactions with you, it's pretty consistent with its hours, and as long as you do what you're told you will not have any issues","You're constantly promised opportunities to advance that barely exist, you're promised raises that will be far less than what you deserve, and you will always feel like you're just treading water. It becomes very clear after a few months that the management plays favorites and if you're not one of the favorites, you will get the minimum raise amount if any, you will never be promoted, and you have zero incentive to do anything besides the bare minimum amount of work required to keep your job there. They do not care about your ideas to improve work flow or the work environment and there is absolutely no wiggle room in how things may be done. They are looking strictly for people to blindly follow orders and will suck the soul out of you. They also pay significantly less than ALL of the competition. It's a bland corporate environment that only benefits the people who are willing to play along and pretend like the company isn't just a money-grabbing, racist corporation.

Side note: When the pandemic hit, every single company besides Publix gave out hazard pay or some sort of bonus compensation. We got a $50 gift card at the beginning of the pandemic and the first time someone at your store got COVID, you got another gift card as some sort of hush money. Disgusting.

2.0,A Moderate Place to Work,"Current Employee, less than 1 year","I've been working part time for about 8 months now. The pay is good enough for a part time job. While I haven't actually gone for tuition reimbursement, from what I understand it is very doable and can be rather nice.","While the managers and team leaders may be nice, that all changes after you've been with the store long enough. You start to notice that all they seem to do is talk on their phones and to each other, while at the same time getting mad when you talk to your fellow co-workers for a grand total of 5 minutes while you still get more work done than they've done all week. Schedule requesting can be a bit tough if its more of a last minute deal. I also work the closing shift which means that I am there from 2:00-11:00, which means I pretty much go to bed shortly after I get home. So with that in mind, I had some personal activities that took place on Mondays and Wednesdays and started around 7:30, so I asked my manager if I could have my schedule shifted to allow me to attend such events (since I work on truck days aka Sunday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday and usually have Mondays off). So the following 2 weeks nothing happened simply because I had some time off requests and they were working around them, but the third week, I get scheduled for Monday and Wednesday for the closing shift, its like stuff like that just doesn't click with them, or maybe I got on someone's bad side because the Publix way is favoring certain employees over others. For instance, the person at my store who is responsible for changing the sale tags on Tuesdays found out one day that they didn't get a promotion, so instead of sucking it up, they left within 20 minutes of being there and left the rest of use to do their job, and as far as I know, nothing has been done to punish them, they still get every single weekend off as a full time associate and seem to get away with doing barely any work within a reasonable amount of time.",,o,o,o,,,,,,,Reviews/Publix-Reviews-E613700.htm,2020-11-03, Grocery Stock Clerk,

- First month in this department the ENTIRE team quit except for myself and two others. 6 in total. Should have been a here is your sign moment...
- They will ask you to resubmit your request after you have already been waiting months and received an initial confirmation. 
- Pay was a constant issue working 3rd shift. I was placed on two-week vacation when I started in this department so I did not lose my vacation time. I had two weeks left and did not want to take it being so new to the team. I was willing to sacrifice this for the new position. I WAS NOT PAID and the SOLUTION was to work 80 HOURS OT OVER THE NEXT MONTH TO GET MY MONEY THAT I WAS ALREADY OWED. SO I WORKED 6-7 DAYS A WEEK TO GET MY PAY FOR THE NEXT MONTH.
- If you took a Friday off working third shift you would be short for the previous and current week. REGARDLESS if you STILL WORKED 5 DAYS THAT WEEK. Solution - Work an extra hour each day next week to make sure you are correctly PAID for that week. No this was not OT.
- Several requests were just lost. We were so short-staffed all the time I could understand ""losing"" request as well I guess. 
- I was clear about the third shift when I was interviewed and placed a REQUEST for 2nd shift. While off work for my scheduled weekend a new hire was given second shift and we were told that's not a decision based on seniority "" Almost everything is when it's convenient in this department including parking "" Then why make a deal about request and seniority too begin with?
- Your ""ideas"" and ""suggestions"" that better the team and department will be stolen and no proper credit will be given. They will ""forget"" you submitted it. I kept folders *
- If your close friends with leadership then your life will be grand. 
- If you do not brown-nose keep that resume handy!
- Management is a do what we say not what we do type team.
- They like to enact policies then only enforce them when its convenient or beneficial to them or their ""favorites""

the pay is good enough to get by but i have requesting more hours and training for weeks only to get lied too, but they will hire more people instead and now i go into work frustrated every day.
The Company says they have Open Door Policy and are there to help you, that is a BIG lie. i was hired to be Meals Clerk and that was shut down due to #COVID-19 and was cross trained into the deli department to be terribly trained, i have Commercial Kitchen through other companies i just don't know the publix way, the pay rate comparison is completely different, a Starting PT Meals Clerk makes the same as a PT Cashier $11.25/hr and a starting Deli clerk makes $12.30/hr. i received no Temp pay or any thing.
publix loves to bribe their employee's with free meal tickets MAYBE once a month.
the benefits list is complete bent LIE.
99% of those are guaranteed as a FT but as a PT employee you get Vision and Dental after 90 days, everything else you need to have worked 1.5k hours or work one Calendar Year of being hired.

- The management 
 When you're part time, all it really means is that they can schedule you up to 38 hours and give you an attitude if you stand up for yourself. I was in my first semester of college taking 6 classes and working that same amount. My manager wouldn't let me go down no matter how much I asked and even called me in on days where I had school. There were at least 3 times where I was really sick and she still made me close the entire department down by myself. The management all have a big ego for no reason. You guys are managers at a grocery store. You're not a doctor, lawyer, or anything significant. I understand it's your job and you need to be serious, but there's a way to be serious without being so insensitive. 
-The dress code 
Straight up discrimination. I'm a man and the main reason why I can't go back is because of the dress code. It's not fair that women can have long hair and earrings but I can't. I'm not trying to move up, so why do I have to follow these stupid rules. Personally, my hair and my earrings are very important to who I am. If you cut off a women's hair without her consent she wouldn't feel like herself. I can tie it up too, but that's not an option. I don't have tattoos all over my face and as a matter of fact I don't have any other piercings other than my ears. I take good care of my hair and I'm not cutting it off just to appeal to some old people. These rules needs to change because it's discrimination. 
-The customers
I don't know who these people think they are but they have no right to talk to me like they did. If I'm out of limes- I'm sorry. You don't need to yell at me. Don't even get me started on old people. They really think the world owes them something. 
-The work

If you're a talented junior to mid-level engineer, go for it. It's a great chance to grow.","All the major decision making happens somewhere outside of your reach. It certainly feels that they are sometimes making the wrong decisions and there's nothing you can do about it. Communication across the company is bad, sometimes almost nonexistent.

Bullying, agro, weak management, in-fighting, awful hiring practices and throwing good money after bad, ultimately led or in my opinion, will lead, to Zopa failing as a business.

The senior leadership team & certain VPs (product management). No strategy & vision in Waters. Toxic management & leadership. Redundancy, furlough and job losses. A business like Waters should not be furloughing especially selling into the Pharmaceutical industry. Nobody questions anything, if you do you are seen as a trouble maker. Decisions are made by someone shouting the loudest and nothing is validated. Asking customers that they know and love is the way forwards. Waters thinks that the products are the best. Solutions and products are so narrow and niche and very very fixated. No flexibility or options. No validation with the customers and the markets. Sometimes, competitors do get it right, and learn from them. Waters is a company that continues to make mistakes over and over again. None of the senior leadership team learn from their mistakes. This has proved to be an eye opener for employees in Waters. All Waters will do is take it out on the employees. No self-reflection what so ever. Be aware of toxic managers in product management and marketing departments. These people have risen through the ranks and will only look out for themselves.... New employees are coming in and not staying longer than 12 months... No training or investment (other than if you are the favorite). Honestly, join Sciex, Agilent or even Thermo.... The companies are all still matrix, but the products and solutions actually meet customer expectations... The processes are so cumbersome it actually prevents people from moving forwards. The company is being driven by cowards who unfortunately, are there to stay. Diversity in the company is a joke. Not once have I seen an ethnic employee promoted or even properly recruited... It's a Caucasian driven company where 'white people' rule.... Waters is so out of touch with their employees and customers it's untrue. Check job descriptions.... The company will lie, recruit you and the job will be nothing like the job spec. HR are absolutely useless.... They will support the cowardly managers at every turn. Don't leave your job to join Waters, it is a decision you will regret. It's a product and career graveyard... So many employees have left... So many vacancies not because of organic growth. Check with previous and existing employees.... You are better off being unemployed for a while and look for a job with more meaning and worth. The company motto 'deliver benefit' yes, only to the senior leadership team. Not to the employees and the customers.... the individuals that really matter.",,x,x,x,1,1,1,1,1.0,,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Waters-Reviews-E5431.htm,2020-09-24, Director of Marketing,

I have lost so many colleagues... dropping like flies in the company.
HR ( human remains) what a joke!! They will side with management - make no mistake of this.
Long serving employees stopped asking questions, why fight - just join. No spirit, no questions asked.
Just madness to make the same mistakes over again... let’s launch products & promote services that customers do not want & need.

Old fashioned management styles, managers only interested in themselves, never take time to say thanks for hard work etc, often don’t even bother to say good morning. 
Keep employees in the dark about most things, communication very poor, lots of finding out information second or third hand rather than direct. 
Lack of interest/guidance in personal development so high staff turnover. Generally low engagement and motivation in NPO and nothing being done to improve this. Keep making pointless new rules and attitude is very much “if you don’t like it leave, you can be replaced”. Small or no bonuses, very hush hush about bonuses and pay.

They are very good at rolling the red carpet at the beginning...
Some senior managers are cowards with no backbone
Check the job spec & verify all tasks in the job spec. They will over sell the role to make it look more than it is

Waters is a company that does not like to give their employees (and customers) no choice

No CRM, no new technology ... this is the way we always do things - why change!!

Managers will pat each other on the back - never once with self reflection. 
Nobody leaves this place, seriously, people stay until retirement .... 
really really read this before you think about joining Waters 
They will be sweetness & light during the honeymoon phase - after that - it’s gone!

Do not think they have a good reputation, it’s not the competitors doing the damage - it’s Waters senior managers.... 

Only the favourites get promoted & certain people can walk around with impunity & no consequences. This gives them the courage & confidence to do what they want.... 

Most employees are fighting the fire & keeping their head down. Don’t be fooled by the number of vacancies... it’s not because of organic growth btw. Either people have left, been fired or just removed from the business. If you don’t play to the tune of the managers, life will be very difficult for you. All the managers are correct all the time!

They spam you from the side lines while listening into your calls to tell you what to say and do, then it flusters you, and then tell you that you missed a few things because of the fact that they were spamming you about other stuff WHILE flustering you. It’s a horrible away to go about helping. The managers for the most part are useless, they all have the same job but make random titles to make it look different but they have the exact same title. They just sit in your calls and listen to you and then say they’ll support you cause they’re the manager on duty in that moment and not respond for 10-15 mins when you actually do need them, and then also give you the wrong answer after the wait. If you call in sick you owe that time back to them so you have to use one of your days off in the next few weeks to make up for that. Bathroom breaks are unpaid, I get normal breaks not being paid for and that’s fine, but the fact that they can’t pay for you to go use the bathroom is sad. You are forced into a religious charity which isn’t even a good one when you read into it, you also don’t have a choice in which one you want to do. If you can’t do the religious charity then they’ll probably fire you so save yourself the trouble if you’re atheist, especially when the donors are religious in the most insane way possible. You aren’t making a difference because you’re begging one person for money to help another, especially during COVID when the people you’re begging money from are already struggling. And this religious charity is based in the US, who didn’t get much support during COVID from the government. If you do get lucky to get money, and it’s not what THEY want, they only want monthly donations on a credit card or through your debt, then thats unfortunate. You got a one time gift of 100 dollars? That’s rough, should have been monthly donations. Even if you broke it down and they paid 100 dollars in the course of the 12 months that’s still better than the 100 dollars one time. I was told that I need to hit a certain % of monthly donations a week in order to be “safe.” Any good reviews has to be written by management because they’re completely not true. If you have any morals or care about people in any way, this isn’t the job for you. I got in trouble more than enough times because I wasn’t making my “second ask” which is when they say no ask again, and then when they say no to the second, ask again. You have to ask 3 times and instead of helping build relationships with these people, you’re tearing them down from ever wanting to support again by constantly pressuring them when they’re not financially able too. That’s why again if you have morals, don’t do this job please! Also if you value your computer in any way, don’t work here because they make you download a ton of programs that slow it down drastically, even with the best gaming PC out there.",,x,x,x,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Reviews/Causeworx-Reviews-E936542.htm,2020-11-03, Fundraiser,

Every way and everywhere you look at Porch there are rampant issues. The software engineering organization has been losing senior engineers, key leaders and managers at a continually increasing pace. I'm no longer confident that Porch has enough of the right people to even meet their goals. Not that they ever could. The dizzying pace of pivoting and chasing new money makers, has created a product and engineering organization that is overworked and spread ridiculously thin. The majority of the remaining key engineering talent is bogged down supporting dozens of services, product lines and business asks. 

Porch lacks the money and focus to keep strong people at the company. The furlough, toxic salary plans and layoffs are just symptoms of a senior leadership team that had every opportunity to succeed and squandered it at every chance.

In the year that I have been with Porch, I have repeatly seen people with zero experience get promoted over people with many years experience.  I have witnessed this company just emotionally destroyed what used to be happy people.  They are now moving all of there small branches to Mexico and focusing solely on insurance.  When you work at a company that the only happy people are managers, that is a problem.  The leads and supervisors will tell you it is a toxic environment.  They deceive you from the minute you show up for your interview.  Telling you your pay is one thing, when in actually, your pay is $10.58 an hour.  If you are one of those lucky 1% who make the full bonus structure, you will be rewarded with a $1200 bonus check.  They will tell you it is a customer service  sales job.  What it really is, is cold calling telemarketing.  They do not care about the employees, so because of this, sick people come to work all of the time because they can not afford to miss work.  They are a revolving door because the good people leave for better work environments and better pay.  The people who stay are the ones who feel they can not find anything better, so they stay and complain with others.  The moto between the employees is another day another penny.  If you are an younger female and white, you won't reach managment for many years.  Where you have male counterparts that hired are for management fresh out of college with zero experience and female coworkers that are nonwhite get promoted.

During snowpocolypse, Costco started to punish employees who couldn't make it to work and didn't have the PTO to cover it. They later reversed the decision for hourly employed, but salary employees were still not allowed to use sick time for weather excuses.
When COVID started to become a concern, many employees asked for accommodations to work from home.  At first Costco refuses because they felt it was unfair to those working in the warehouses. Then people started to get sick, so they started to let people who had health concerns work from home. Then someone died and Costco got slammed in the news. Well, once members were upset Costco started sending people home. 
Now Costco is requiring people back into the office - even teams that are working successfully from home and maintaining productivity. They won't allow LOA, wwon't consider health concerns. When you ask someone in management with other people around the answer is ""We will take it on a case by case basis."" When you ask them 1-1, the answer changes to ""Quit, demote, or go to the office.""
I joined Costco because of their reputation, but their unwillingness to adapt is destroying that reputation and it's apparent its a repeating issue.

Competitive pay for the work and excellent benefits for part-time employee's.",Management can be a pain but each warehouse is different.,,v,v,v,5,5,4,4,5.0,5.0,Reviews/Costco-Wholesale-Reviews-E2590.htm,2020-10-18, Cashier Assistant (Front End Assistant),
1.0,Don't Believe in the Hype,"Current Employee, less than 1 year",Honestly this work is not what its made out to be. If you work the front end doing super easy work (except with carts) getting full hours this job will be great but if you work any of the hard departments and the HARDEST depart of produce then this job all depends on your team. The pay is okay lots of warehouse jobs willing to pay $15 hours as a base and raises are only hours put in (5-8 years) to be maxed out.,"There are alot of cons at Costco at least at the Duluth location. The co-workers in the afternoon and evening shift are filled with despicable, condescending, and immature workers. You're practically in a high school with how much judgement you get and they aren't very high on character either. As for the produce department the training is absolutely horrible at least at the Duluth location. Their training is a sink or swim environment which is why they're are short staffed. It also doesn't help that being short staffed that when you do get a hard working employee that being short staffed you can't train to teach that employee because nobody can teach them. Costco is not a good place to work and their turnover rate at least in the Duluth location is high and why they struggle to have employee stay at the hardest department like produce or any other very rigorous department. None of the co-workers shed any explanation or pragmatic way on working the morning shift at Costco and is why everyone literally everyone in the produce department is over 28+ years old (the youngest being maybe 27). Don't believe in the hype at Costco unless you work a easy department like front end, customer service, HR, or any other easy department. Working at the hardest department you still get paid the base pay as anyone. If you think working produce is the same as working the front end doing no labor work but getting the same pay the produce department will always have a terrible culture, short staffed, and high turnover. Costco might be pay alot but eventually these types of work environments, culture, and pay will get their back turned on by their employees and will kill long-term success and vision. I wouldn't be surprised if Costco ends up getting beat by another competitor in the next 50 years. Also, good luck working at produce when there is so much dead weight and everyone is 50+ years old. Costco is a terrible place to work. It takes you 1-2+ years to get full time and that only if it is available and everything falls in place from your training, hours, and availability. There are so many variables at Costco that benefits are not fully given either. You get part time benefits which is no equivocal to full time.",,x,r,r,1,1,1,1,1.0,,Reviews/Costco-Wholesale-Reviews-E2590.htm,2020-09-03, Produce Associate,

Some promotions are favoritisms driven And clicks with managers form creating a stressful environment .

Costco cares a lot more about employee socialization and spreading love and viruses than actual work output. If this is your thing, then you will love it here. . 

Sit-stand desk (but only if you are already sick).","Very political, akin to a dictatorship. Let me explain: the CEO is in charge of everything, and every single person in the hierarchy down to the managers exist only to please their superiors. Every single change has to go through the CEO (or his office). He might be a good CEO for retail, but certainly not a good one for IT. He needs to trust his subordinates. . 

I will not be surprised if Costco stocks plummet in a couple of years or so if nothing would change, because the tech people who keep Costco operations up are ignored, in favor of archaic culture perpetuated by management who are very inexperienced with modern tech practices. . 

Compensation is still very uncompetitive, both with salary and benefits. It's a tiny bit better than last year but still falls short compared to the industry average. You won't get enough time off, and you won't get to telecommute (If they say otherwise, it's a lie. Trust me, I work here). Their selling point is job security, which is a double-edged sword: good for lazy and incompetent people, but bad for everyone else who works with these people. . 

Again, no telecommuting. Reason? In the name of equality. There are a lot of employees who are required to be in the office, so tech workers (who should not have issues telecommuting) suffer as well. NO equity, NO fairness. It is simply just, equality. . 

If one employee catches a virus, everybody has to get them as well. This is the management's definition of ""fairness"". Seriously, I am genuinely concerned not only for my health, but also for my life. . 

To their credit, some in management push for change. But again, if the supreme CEO says no, everybody just agrees and all hope goes away. I am not sure exactly how this works, but this is how many people in these positions describe it to us. . 

No one has a real voice, which is why people like me opt to voice out our concerns here in Glassdoor. They continue refusing to listen to the workforce—the people who are not in any political hierarchy—the ACTUAL tech workers. Do I think Costco is a good company to work for? Maybe for retail, but definitely not for IT. .

4.0,Great Company to Start Out With or Even Stay With,"Current Employee, more than 5 years","Pay is fair. The more you work, the faster you get a pay raise. Working past 8 hours counts as overtime (pay x 1.5). Sunday pay is also pay x 1.5.

Schedules are flexible, especially if you're a student. But remember, it is retail (at least at the warehouse level), so the management's/company's needs come first.

Benefits are incredible, even with a part-time position. Instead of elaborating, I'll just say that you would want your company to have the benefits Costco has. When Google was #1 and Costco was #2 on Glassdoor a few years ago, not even Google's benefits were as good as Costco's. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
I don't know if that's changed for Google.

Management is pretty good. There have been three warehouse managers at my location since I started working there. The first one was lazy. The second was very hard-working (now retired). This third one is also hard-working and probably shows more care about the employees than the previous two. So, I'd say each one has been overall better than the last.","There is not any real training prior to starting the job, at least for the department I'm in. This can be tough for newcomers (and it can lead to a lot of rework for current/long-time employees). Fortunately, my experience at a previous company helped me a lot.

The company works with a lot of legacy systems or with software feels like it is still stuck in the 80's or 90's.

4.0,Really Think About It...,"Former Employee, less than 1 year","The experience was overall good. Some supervisors were better than others with direction. You could tell immediately the ones who really will respect you and be kind instead of pushing the envelope with their role as supervisor. The hours were good but you really do work your butt off. You are there to work and not mess around in any capacity.  Some of the customers were really fantastic. You meet A LOT of people there and that can also be the highlight of the day, meeting someone who is actually happy to be at Costco. I would say the best part about working there was the employees. You become a type of family when working together for that long. Be prepared to be thrown into any position at a moments notice and make sure to look appropriate or you will get sent home. Being put in another position gives you the opportunity to learn the new role but also to know the store better to help customers= Win. 

Do not EVER be late. It does not matter if your mother had a heart attack three times in a month and you were late each of those times, you will get a write up.","Customers can be very mean, especially during the holidays about carts. Be prepared to get yelled at in the pouring rain by customers because there are not any carts left. People can only collect so many carts so fast in the rain or just in general.  Telling management you need more people will sometimes help but most often then not they will just tell you to keep working and do your best. Getting yelled at is not in the job description so consider that. One of the biggest downfalls to working at this job was the supervisors. I hate to say it, but only a few of them really work hard. Having supervisors that do not come at you maliciously if you do something wrong is important.

I assisted at check out lanes, pushed carts up from the parking lots, helped members find items in the warehouse, folded clothes, and put items back on shelves from where members dumped them in the warehouse.

The seasonal job was a great way to learn about the company.  I got to try out a lot of different spots in the warehouse and got some good insights into how the company is run for members and shareholders, as well as their policies for employees.

Costco hires with HS diploma or GED.  The warehouse that I was in had several staff members with disabilities (physical, behavioral).","Seasonal work rarely leads to full-time, permanent employment from what I can tell.  Out of over 25 seasonal staff members, I believe they are keeping less than 5 on after 89 days.  The people I know are being retained are all very young so I wouldn't say that Costco hires people over 50 despite press to the contrary.  

The work is very physical.  There is no allowance in the seasonal workforce for physical limitations (for example, a bad knee or back).  There are no sick days or holiday days as part of your employment.

Management at this store are not particularly accessible.  At orientation, we were told repeatedly 'just ask a supervisor or manager', but with the pace of the warehouse operations, there isn't time to sit down with anyone.

2.0,The grass isn’t always greener on the other side.,"Former Employee, less than 1 year","Costco pays its employees well* for work that requires little skill.

*As of March 2019, the starting rate is $15.00 across Canada. A $0.50 raise is incurred after working 1,040 hours, then a $1.00 raise is incurred for every 1,040 additional hours worked until reaching the top rate. The top rate is $25.25 for Service Assistants and $27.15 for Service Clerks. At this point, employees become eligible for lump sum payments twice per year that start at $3000.","1. Little opportunity for full-time employment.

All employees start as Seasonal or Regular Part Time (RPT) employees. RPT employees are guaranteed a minimum of twenty five hours per week. Seasonal and Limited Part Time (LPT) employees are not guaranteed hours. Opportunities for full-time employment come by every now and then but they are awarded strictly by seniority, even if the most senior applicant is woefully incompetent.

There are opportunities to pick up additional hours in the warehouse as an RPT employee, but these are generally hard to come by. Overtime is out of the question. Management will have you sign a document forfeiting any accumulated overtime should you do so.

2. Little opportunity for growth and development.

The only way you’ll move up in the company is if you’re an attractive female willing to put out, so I’ve been told...

3. Little regard for health and safety, or upholding their own ethical values when handling health and safety claims.

The average warehouse has three times as many workplace accidents than the average Walmart. When you’re inevitably injured, expect management to do everything in their power to jeopardize your WSIB claim. Tactics include incorrectly completing paperwork, withholding paperwork, withholding mail, and outright bullying and harassment.",,x,r,r,2,4,1,3,2.0,,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Costco-Wholesale-Reviews-E2590_P1060.htm?filter.iso3Language=eng,2020-01-29, Stocker,

Benefits are good.  All new employees get front-loaded 3 weeks of PTO, AND the company shuts down for one week during the December holidays.

There  are guards keep on roaming around and will keep eyes on you all the time if they found you chatting with fellow employees and even if you smile they will report to HR and you will get a warning letter from HR and it will impact on your salary.

they treat their employees like daily wage workers.

Management doesn’t care about the employees.

You need to work and work do not complain forgot your family in the end you do one mistake and you are gone.

They expect from their employees that all the employees should perform their allotted task within the ETA but the management don’t follow the ETA they are not releasing the salary on time.

Training - They said that we provide 3 to 6 months training. But they don't they rushed training modules within 2 to 4 weeks. In a month training + work will be taken from you. You will have no time to manage. How can a person do 6 months training in 1 month and then start working with zero errors.

Career and growth - You will have no permanency in your job. You can lose it any point of time. They believe in hire and free fire.
They say we are growing faster. They will hire every Tuesday and fire you without paying anything. I joined and half of my colleagues were fired before me. Within one month I got fired too, without any salary.

You will see your colleagues are getting invisible as days pass by. They will take work from anyone but will pay no rupee to them.

He was manipulative, never won new work/contracts, and kept hiring new people when there was very little work to spread out. Not sure why he still had the position he did. Blatantly stated that he was there to ride out a contract until he retired. In general, under his control in the Federal sector, there were tiny raises the majority of the years I worked there, most raises below 3% and some as low as 1.7%. Benefits were extremely expensive and continued to increase every year. You are required to meet certain goals to receive a discount on your insurance. 
I would NOT recommend working in the Federal division for this company. There are other divisions that are well organized from what I could tell by working with project managers in them.

1.0,Russian Roulette - You Feelin Lucky?!,"Former Employee, more than 5 years",The company has great name recognition. People know the name and think highly of it for excellence. Which helps when you inevitably move on.  Some departments are run well others are miserable at best.,"The company has loads of offices and directions you could move around in. If you are allowed to. Each department is run differently, some say flex time and work from home is encouraged, I was told I had to ski to work during a snow storm when the train was down. 

In the particular group I was in, you couldn't touch calculations the first couple of years. then you review other's work and everyone had their ""thing"". The anchorage person, the steel guy, the concrete guy etc. This sounds great, until you've been there long enough that you realize in the last 10 - 15 years, you've only checked anchor bolt calculations and are essentially stuck at CDM now with 10 yrs under your belt and no experience. This is quite literally the only reason some groups don't have turnover, it became a way for management to provide job security for themselves (as they are the only person to know how to do something, or the only one with a stamp there etc) and a way to keep the employee down. 

In the 6 years I worked there, I believe I had something like 6.5% increase in my pay in total. Promotions were a joke. There's criteria you must meet to advance, but even if you checked all those boxes (if you were lucky enough to receive the work that would allow you to) you'd still be told you needed to meet the criteria of the next level to qualify for it. (ie ENG I would have to perform at ENG III levels to get ENG II) but ENG I won't be assigned ENG III work, so good luck to you. I believe the last time someone was promoted to a managerial role (principal, VP, SVP, etc) within my group was maybe 12-15 years ago. Other groups had promotions yearly. 

I had some serious complaints (fire-able complaints in my opinion) I brought up to management, which went no where. I brought it up to their manager, they gave a talking to my manager, but it went no where from there and it continued.  I was told HR was informed about it. they were not. I only know this because upon my exit interview, I casually mentioned it to my HR rep, who was totally taken aback. Which opened up a huge can of worms. 

Over the course of my time there, some of the things I was told that stand out are:
~When I wasn't assigned work, I was asked to make round every 15 minutes until someone gave me work. Which 99.99% of the time was busy work, like scanning papers or binding calcs.
~I'm not allowed to go outside of my group for work
~I'm not allowed to email my bosses about tasks I was given (sometimes if it was unclear, seemed incorrect or wasting time,) they didn't want a record of it. I was told this many times and many times caught myself before the bus they sent my way hit me, my saving grace were these emails. 
~When I bought a house and started a family I was told by my manager that he married the company and my priorities are wrong if I want to grow in the company. 
~If I'm not in my seat and he can't see my face, I'm not working.
~He told my female coworker that she should be a good mother and stay at home with her kids.
~He told my other female coworker that she isn't a good wife, because her husband doesn't come home to her in the kitchen with dinner. 
~I was told to stop charging ""no-work"" when not working on a project and I should keep charging clients.
~I stopped counting the amount of times I should ""do him a favor and quit already"".

I'll leave it with that. Thanks for reading this condensed book.
