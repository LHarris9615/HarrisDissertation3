The first few months was enjoyable and the onboarding process was supportive, however in 2023 it pains me to say if you are of a different ethnic background you have no future in this company from my observation. Other issues: - discriminate against disabilities (purposely not hiring people with disabilities for their specific reasons) - Hiring minorities for a short period before bullying them out the role. -Management do gang up on staff and make their job harder than it needs to be, shockingly this company supports mind charity so you would think they would be more sensitive to peoples mental wellbeing instead of contributing negatively to this. - No opportunity to grow if you're not liked by senior team, this can be simply because of the way you look and nothing to do with your work ethic. - During the pandemic majority of staff that was let go were from the ethnic minority group, which was strategic as a week later the seniors and management team were all given pay rises :/ - I had notice a lot of people leave this job within the first 2 years, hence the constant high in demand hiring process. -no one in senior team are of an ethnic minority (this should have been my first red flag) so there is really no opportunity to grow. I really don't like to play the race game but in a company where its so blatant i have to be honest.

They furloughed staff and gave pay cuts across the board in 2020 but still gave themselves giant bonuses. There was absolutely ZERO transparency about pay cuts. The old CEO was so out of touch that he was told to give company updates in a less ""wealthy"" looking room in his house. He must have gotten a little slap on the wrist for something because his title changed to President and the old President took over as the CEO. The C-suite is just a giant boys club where no innovation happens and they are resting on their 30 year old laurels. Thankfully in tech you don't have to interface with them too often.

FedEx is still Not leaving me alone (FedEx fired me in January 2022 for my excellent work there), - like - in this moment FedEx is hindering me to put my review here, - FedEx does not want anybody to know their Real Organized Criminal Gang FedEx face. FedEx hacked all of my personal electronics, including my Toyota, and, was deleting my personal files with my evidences against FedEx. Some files were completely ruined - I could see only the names of the files and nothing else. Some of my folders were emptied. My recorded calls with FedEx were deleted from my smart phone or edited - the recorded phrases were replaced with others (by the same voices). My voice mail messages on my phone were listened by FedEx on the purpose - before I knew about them. My adobe software on my laptop was constantly “edited” that I could not use it. Audio on my laptop is ruined. My accounts were blocked very often and my passwords were constantly changed. When I was going to a public computer in a library - it was the same, my accounts were blocked. I could not operate my Toyota Highlander with satellite connection - as I wanted, - they were stopping my navigation to work during my trip out of town and accelerating my Toyota to 106 miles per hour inside the city limits. My Toyota did not obey to me anymore. Anything in my Toyota I was trying to do - FedEx was blocking me from doing this. I had to sell my Highlander. FedEx changed my favorite music application on my phone, - they changed the song words - to what FedEx wanted me to listen - their requirements to me. When I was coming to my Toyota - without me doing anything - FedEx was starting playing my music from my phone without my wish - through my JBL audio system in Toyota. Later FedEx killed my favorite music application and I can not use it anymore. FedEx broke remotely my Medtronic Minimed insulin pump and blew my Guardian wireless blood sugar sensor up on me under the tapes into the pieces. I reported this hacking to Medtronic Minimed. FedEx was blocking my most important calls, like to the clinics, and, muting my interview with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. I had to call from other phones. FedEx was disconnecting me from my internet and switching my Wi-Fi to airplane mode. VPN protection does not help at all. FedEx was reading in front of my eyes my emails and moving on my personal laptop screen the scroll bars as “FedEx wish”. It looks like a help desk took over your computer and doing something while you were watching them. FedEx idiots were discussing my personal life 24/7/365 on their conference calls on the speakers loudly and openly with a lot of witnesses at FedEx. Every day FedEx was talking at FedEx conference calls about - what I was doing and talking about a day before, what tone I was using, etc. FedEx employees asked me in the closed office: “How FedEx is Listening to me?” — Then immediately FedEx “manager” was called to RUN to us to STOP That TALK.",,x,x,x,1,1,1,1,1.0,1.0,Reviews/FedEx-Reviews-E613014.htm,2023-01-29, Sr. Operations Administrator,

I felt that my work was monotonous, I did the same thing and it was very repetitive, I didn't feel that I was going to be promoted to a new position. The use of refurbished equipment, I often had to set up equipment for people who came in but it broke down. This does not go to the position, but it was in the year and also the company where I worked.

There were some attempts at culture in the past: some felt fake and forced while others were fun. You mostly just work in your immediately project team with not much opportunity to network across the firm. - PTO is not competitive (15 days or less and they continue to take days like President's Day away this year) - 401k match doesn't vest immediately, it takes 3 years - Raises are minimal (2-3% per year) if you even get one. There are not annual COLA raises, only merit raises. - Promotions are non-existent for Sr. Architects and Directors. If you are below that level then you have a chance and they usually take ~1-2 years - Some coworkers are deadweight or a negative. The interview and training process of new people needs refinement. - A lot of projects are oversold. Also, due to being ""agile"" the director only gives you a week or two to build the initial product backlog. In reality, it typically takes longer to even flesh out a development-ready backlog for the first sprint. - They are cheap! They won't even buy employees a monitor so they can do their job, like work on spreadsheets.",,v,x,v,2,3,2,5,4.0,3.0,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Perficient-Reviews-E9329.htm,2023-03-01, Solutions Architect,

Aside from the company's amenity-loaded Global Headquarters (world class facilities, on-site fitness center& cafeteria, monthly massages, 2-mile walking trail, etc.) the organization has a track record of consistency and success that is hard to argue with. Franklin offers a multitude of advancement opportunities for those who are eager for development and added responsibility, and also possesses leadership teams that are accessible and willing to roll up their sleeves to accomplish the goal(s) at hand. Work-life balance is prioritized by the organization and there is a clear ""family first"" culture. You won't find many (if any) better companies in Fort Wayne.","Franklin Electric could benefit from added visibility in the employment market!

2.0,Like marrying into a family that hates you,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",- The benefits are good for a Fort Wayne company that still requires you to be in the office. - Free beverages,"- The IT department is mostly management, and most managers have only one or two employees. So they have an abundance of time to micromanage you.

- Because there is so much management, all of them are striving to be promoted but don't put any effort into their jobs. As a result, they are quick to take credit for the work of non-managers while also berating them. This is especially bad if you are a developer, as that manager will remain silent while this happens, but will apologize to you in private after the fact, in an effort to placate you without making any real effort to improve things.

- If you are unlucky enough to be hired as a developer, you will be a silo, as they struggle to keep developers because of the previously mentioned issues as well as the head of the department only allowing employees to be paid the bare minimum and discouraging promotions.

- Goal posts will move, but deadlines will not. Success is met with disappointment you didn't do more. Aim for failure so at least their disappointment is slightly justified but you didn't have to waste your efforts.

- Management is proud of how little money they spend on IT resources and brag about it regularly, which helps lead to underequipped and understaffed projects.",,x,v,v,2.0,3.0,1.0,3,1.0,2.0,Reviews/Franklin-Electric-Reviews-E1433.htm,2023-02-26, Applications Developer,

2.0,Kroger sees adequate staffing as optional,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","• It's not hard to get hired. They've repeatedly hired same day. All non-salaried positions are part time, which worked well for me since I am also in college and need to balance classes with financially supporting my family.","• scheduling is a mess. There are always gaps, or misscheduled people (scheduled out of their known availablitly). For any worker, part time can be anything from 7 hours to 40+ hours, which is mind boggling in the lack of consistency from week to week. • Constantly cutting hours for all departments. In my time as a front end employee, I have had to also handle backkstock, truck loads without training (no codes, no keys, no guidance), bakery, floral, and produce. All while still being expected to manage and remain present at the front end. There are departments without so fre hours that they have to choose between not having a person to open, or not having a person to close. And that work just gets shoved on the the sales department. Yet I'm also supposed to check emails, which is reading, responding, printing, coaching, organizing, and so on. I can't do that while on the sales floor, but I am not given what I need to do so on the clock. So I cannot consistently meet any expectation. At least, not to an acceptable degree by my standards. • Inadequate training and support. After a year, I am still learning there are more tasks I am supposed to get done that have never been mentioned to me. Some tasks I know I am supposed to do, but after 4 months of approaching management about getting the codes I need to do those tasks, I have given up on that. It's apparently not important enough for me to get what I require of management to fully do my job. • I will regularly be the only person managing 5 terminals (4 SCO, 1 traditional register), while also being customer service, (which is split between two desks) and the person who handles phone calls for every department since no one else will-or often can-answer the phone. This includes all the irritation of customers wanting immediate help all at once and getting angry we ith you, the lowly employee who has no options, to be everyone's verbal and emotional punching bag. • Inconsistent compliance with laws regarding sale of age-restricted items. Despite repeatedly bringing this issue up with management and HR, nothing has been done about this. I thought thus would be a critical issue, but evidently I thought wrong. I have repeatedly coached checker-trained people on our policies, but that has not been enough for coworkers to start acting in accordance to store policies. • If it weren't for my old manager setting up the documents for trying to get me a raise as a supervisor, then I would be making minimum wage. That's right, they pay supervisors the same as a cashier. So you are not guaranteed even one red cent more an hour for all of this. • Managment is spineless. If someone is yelling at me or a cashier, calling us all the curse words or whatnot because we have policies, then management gives them what they want despite policies (be it ID checks, returns, bottle refunds, etc ) they have fostered an environment where customers abusing employees is beneficial for customers. This is a terrible environment to foster, and no manager should ever aspire to creating this sort of space.",,x,x,x,,2,2,2,2.0,2.0,Reviews/Quality-Food-Reviews-E1811.htm,2023-04-08, Front End Supervisor,

The org is in a crisis, and instead of focusing on defining a clear business goal and trusting teams to do whatever they need to do to chase it, leadership is ignoring business problems and micromanaging how teams structure their work and physically where they do it. Conversations about return to office have also been explicitly disrespectful of the realities of people with disabilities and have ignored the reality that parents are not dealing with the same child care landscape they were navigating pre-Covid. There is also a dizzying level of complexity in org structures, which makes it a massively high friction political undertaking to push a small action through. Most alarmingly, the org has been extremely slow to act on abusive and dysfunctional people in senior leadership roles.

1.0,Red Flags Alert: The Dark Side of LendingTree Revealed,Current Employee,"In the realm of technology, specifically software engineering, you'll find a select few teams that excel in performance, have realistic levels of positivity, prioritize employee well-being, exhibit genuine care about the company, and remain motivated even after several layoffs. The work load is entirely manageable and reasonable as a SWE. No one is making you work over 40-hours a week. Individuals who go above and beyond in their work are typically those who genuinely find enjoyment in what they do.","Mandating employees to return to the office will not solve the challenges faced by the global economy, nor will it address the issues stemming from senior leadership's inadequate decision-making, at times. Double-digit attempts of the same project is not a sign of sound decision making, no matter the sycophant running it. The data organization has been slow to evolve, reminiscent of the 2008 era. It has primarily fostered nepotism and complacency, with a significant dearth of experience, teamwork, and effective leadership. Individuals in the data org who position themselves as the ultimate authorities on all aspects of applications, and the senior leaders who endorse this notion, display a profound lack of understanding regarding the realm of software engineering. The data org's mere existence in its current form is determinantal to the company. Lastly, it is important to understand that starting from 2018, HR plays a significant role in running the company, but unfortunately, the outcomes have been unsatisfactory. Some HRBPs lack sufficient experience and readiness to effectively address the genuine challenges that emerge. Instead, they frequently form support cliques resembling those found in middle school, catering to individuals with weaker personalities and a tendency for passive-aggressiveness. This approach inadequately addresses the core concerns and burdens managers with unnecessary personnel-related tasks.. HR needs to be reminded that running a business is an operational endeavor, not a playground or a game.",,x,x,x,3,3,1,4,1.0,1.0,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/LendingTree-Reviews-E11154.htm,2023-05-20, Anonymous Employee,

For the employee who touched me (also a higher-up), HR told me that, ""that's just how he is"". - Health benefits are very expensive and barely cover anything. I worked closely with the person who designed the benefits program, and they only care about money. - Management shares other employees' confidential information (PHI, etc) with people they like. I have been told by my management about a colleague's mental health diagnosis, which the employee told her in confidence. - Was made to attend a mandatory christmas party with the team packed into a conference room for hours, got COVID 2 days later. Was guilted for taking 2 days off to recover. - Micromanagement is rampant - Low pay for high-volume roles - Roles are typically packed with more work than realistically possible.

2.0,Mandarin Oriental Miami Property,"Former Employee, less than 1 year",Stress management and hard labor,"Experience at MOMIA was an extreme disappointment. The interviews with the managers were professional and set high standards for the company, however, once you begin your employment, it is not the case. During the interview, was told they have a great training program. Absolutely zero training was given, except one day. I was told they were too busy at the front desk to provide training. The only training they provide is when a front desk agent performs poorly due to lack of management. The responsibilities as a front desk agent go far beyond the actual job description they sell you with. Zero PBX department, having to take reservations for spa and restaurant, having to follow up with housekeeping constantly as rooms are never ready after check in time, assisting with luggage etc. Management expects you to escort guests to provide their 5 star service, however, when they put you alone at front desk for a whole shift, you cannot leave the desk. FOM is not welcoming as he scolds you constantly and demotivates the front office team easily on a daily basis. He will make downgrading personal comments, instead of caring and listening to his employees. His behaviour changes hourly. The only way for him to listen to his team, you have to go talk to upper management (and even this is not enough...). FOM does not know how to make schedules, as he will only put one agent for an entire shift, he will call you on your day off to cover and will ask you to do overtime. FOM will always make it a big deal if an agent has to go on break (as it is legal). Unfortunately, it has happened way to many times where agents were not even able to go on break because no assistance at front desk was taking place. FOM will never back up his team and will only care for himself and cover his tracks. The FOM has great experience, but is NOT a good leader. Management tends to only listen to their employees when you are at your lowest and calling for help. Instead of taking action, they just listen. The turnover is horrendous.... There is absolutely no work and life balance. Zero recognition for hard work is mentioned within the department. They only care about statistics, reviews and revenue. They should at least recognise their employees for holding their 5 star after failing the whole onboarding experience. Overall, Mandarin Oriental Group is a prestigious company, however, MOMIA property is an extreme disappointment and shame. This property does not deserve a 5 star rating, as they do not give their own employees 100% value. Instead of setting high standards for marketing, they should put more value into their employees and not expect the front office to hold the 5 stars. It saddens me that this property is closing, but I believe it is for the best.",,x,v,r,4,4,2,1,2.0,3.0,Reviews/Mandarin-Oriental-Hotel-Group-Reviews-E378825.htm,2023-03-19, Guest Service Agent,

The scheduling team is rude. Students fly maybe once a week because of plane availability. There are way too many students because the sales team is very good at lying and management is so greedy and doesn’t turn anyone down. This leads to students enrolling who don’t care about aviation at all and show up to lessons unprepared or dont show up at all.

2.0,In my opinion— Root is not it.,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",It's difficult to identify any significant pros about working at Root Inc.,"Root Inc has a work culture that can be unbearable for employees. The culture is a blame-game, leading to an unhealthy and unsupportive work environment. The management team at Root Inc lacks the necessary skills to lead and support their team effectively. Their decisions often negatively impact employees and the company as a whole. Root Inc expects employees to work long hours without appropriate compensation for overtime. This leads to poor work-life balance and high levels of burnout among employees. Root Inc offers compensation below industry standards, which is not commensurate with the workload and expectations of employees. Additionally, there is a lack of transparency around bonuses and salaries, which creates a sense of mistrust. Root Inc does not provide employees with opportunities for professional development or career advancement. This leaves employees feeling stuck in their roles and unfulfilled in their careers. Overall, Root Inc is a highly unsatisfactory place to work. The toxic work culture, ineffective management, and inadequate compensation and growth opportunities make it an unappealing workplace.",,x,x,x,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Root-Inc-Reviews-E1372126.htm,2023-02-24, Anonymous Employee,

The current systems are not equipped to deal with cross-office working. I work in a smaller team, where employing more engineers would help us deliver a wider range of products to meet market demand. The failed acquisition stalled the company's roadmaps and resulted in restructuring.

2.0,Low level low salary job,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Staff discounts are pretty good. 
Flexibility to WFH is good, you have work life balance.","Low salary, low level and boring work. Insane that for a company that is constantly putting the price of their groceries up they pay staff such little money that keeping up with the rising cost of living is hard. 
The culture in the BNE support office is like high school- no one will talk/make an effort with people if the permanent staff members know their colleague is ‘only on a contract’. The attitudes and lack of respect towards contract workers from permanent colleagues is toxic and they really go out of their way not to talk to you if they don’t have to.
If you’re hoping to work your way up in the support offices you need to be ‘in’ with the popular crowd as it’s all about who you know. 

There seems to be huge jumps in salaries if you’re someone who works on the phones. Unfair for those people who work just as hard but may not have to take hundreds of phone calls a day and are slapped with the lowest salary offered. 

They are big on development hour for staff but it’s also not easily accessed knowledge on what steps you can take yourself to plan to climb the ladder in the company. 

Very high turnover of staff- all due to contract work which constantly contributes to permanent team member’s superiority and lack of respect to contract workers hoping to become permanent and enjoy their job. 

Not an enjoyable job at all.",,x,r,x,2,1,3,5,1.0,4.0,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Woolworths-Group-Reviews-E7481.htm,2023-01-10, Anonymous Employee,

4.0,"Great Culture, Lack Of Career Path Clarity","Former Employee, more than 3 years","Working for a large org like Woolworths can feel a bit like you're a small cog. But the work that we is rewarding, as we're helping everyday Australians get more value for their essentials. Every team I had made contact within the business was easy interaction as most conversation happen via Google chats. Each person I interacted with was highly specialized in the area that they work in. This meant a great opportunity to learn and grow from others. Working from home is a huge plus, but sometimes collaborating or workshops are much better if done in person. I would encourage to have at least 1 day a week thats in the office. The bonus is a great incentive for going above and beyond in your BAU. However, don't expect to get 100% of what's in your contract. Flexible working hours, although similar to WFH, flexible working hours to me meant being able to post-pone work related tasks to later in the evening if I had to run any mid day errands, or if I needed a bit of extra sleep in.","The pay, sub par compared to industry standard. Trying to get a raise is almost impossible. Management will say that they benchmark the salaries often given your skill set but this is never on an individual basis. The benefits are standard and nothing to write home about. Only 4 weeks annual leave regardless of your term of stay. Only 5% off your grocery shops. No health care. Very small amount given for a mobile device plan. Lack of career growth, as a mature business, promotions or new roles are few and far between. Even if there might be a role you're interested in, you need to do the leg work to find out what's available because it's never shared internally.

2.0,You Have To Be Career Oriented,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Cohere as a company is moving in the right direction - the technology is cutting edge and is helping advance healthcare. It has done nothing but grow at an exponential pace, which some may find exciting. Cohere is almost entirely remote which eliminates commuting and allows you to live wherever you want. The PTO policy is likely better than average (4 weeks - but includes sick, bereavement, etc.) If your priority in life is your career, you function well with little structure, enjoy consistent change, and value growth, this would likely be a good fit.","If your priority in life is anything other than your career, Cohere will likely not be a good long term fit. Unfortunately like many places nowadays the culture confuses ""hard"" work with volume. Work life balance and respect for personal time are in very few people's cards. The only time you will come close to working 40 hours in a week is if you take a day off and thats just the honest truth. After a few years I could count on 1 hand, maybe 2, how many times I took a true lunch break and im confident that applies to the majority of people in salaried positions (hourly get scheduled breaks and lunches). Being fully remote at Cohere means an incredibly heavy meeting oriented culture. You will spend anywhere from 50-90% of your day on calls and in virtual meetings to make up for the lack of in office collaboration. This of course seldom leaves time for 'real' work to be completed during regular hours, thus leaving your early mornings or evenings to feel like you are able to get anything done. Besides PTO, remainder of the benefits are very average. Compensation for most positions also feel average, maybe slightly better. If you are not willing to put in an extra 10-20 hours / week as the standard expectation, are easily frustrated by constant change and lack of structure, do not enjoy high demand in a high(er) pressure culture, this is likely not the place for you.",,x,o,v,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Cohere-Health-Reviews-E3149304.htm,2023-04-22, Anonymous Employee,

1.0,Disorganized Mess - Avoid at all costs,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",The ample amount of VTO and PTO makes working there tolerable,This disorganization is insane. Management makes changes on whims and expects us to catch on but can never explain their own process when we ask questions. We have to placate Humana since they are over us but Humana agents disregard us at every turn. They waste so much of our time but we can't call them when we need clarification on anything. So much frustration and confusion. The absoulute worst offender is Business Planning. They have never been able to project adequate numbers so they're always innundating our support channel with requests for agents to take calls. This takes away our ability to tend to other functions as we're stuck on the phones due to poor projections by them. I understand adjusting to business needs but business planning doesn't have a clue on how to schedule in a manner that covers all areas adequately. The amount of stress we deal with is too much at times. Lots of unaddressed tech issues that need to be looked at. Here we are in the middle of a huge ramp up and they let go of hundreds of seasonal employees hired to assist with the heavy call volume. The decisions made by this company is the reason most of their employes are running for the hills. Avoid Cohere at all costs.

There is an egregious lack of respect and professionalism for employee’s personal or private information. Confidential health information has been shared amongst employees, packing houses, customers for multiple employees; even senior members of the executive team have been over heard talking about other employees out in the open. The vast majority of the Executive team has been with Sunkist less than 4 years and it seems the new leadership philosophy is “out with the old, in with the new”, excising heart, history and integrity. Changes are made just for the sake of change, not for the greater good of the organization. The culture is AWFUL; no real mentoring or professional development, just a sink or swim attitude and the feeling that management is rooting for you to fail. HR is useless, but love to praise themselves, constantly adding staff without effectively changing or improving anything for the employees. There is a lot of inter-company conflict between Sunkist and her sister company, Fruit Growers Supply.

Then as soon as it gets near bonus time they’ll terminate you(and trust me they’ll find a way). Bonus is paid in March and as soon as February hit I started getting pressured about work performance from meetings and emails then when I got even more of my 400+ claims done they terminated me on an allegation of misconduct after I put in blood, sweat, and tears with them for over a year. Granted I worked for my bonus of $9k for an entire year then all of sudden I’m getting called into HR for some BS investigation and that’s after I already had to keep meeting about my low performance almost every day in February.

If you are looking for that, you have about a 30% chance of finding it at State Farm if not slimmer.

We are tracked by our mouse movements, being in the right call state, the amount of time on the phone and the time typing notes after the fact. We have to reach certain numbers of tasks. Some people are scheduled for task time. Others phone only. So we are competing to reach a goal on an uneven playing field.

4.0,Too much abuse,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",My first 6 months was amazing. I’ve been with the company since 2018. It is easy to excel most departments are relatively easy as long as you keep up with the pace. Pro -benefits -Beautiful faculty -Entry level positions have a great work life balance. If it wasn't for the benefits being so amazing I would have never remained with the company after the first 6 months.,"Cons -Miscommunication When applying to new position we are often given incorrect vital details that help with accepting the position. The management claims they had no idea of the updates only for us to find out time and time again the updates are 6 months to 1 year old. The miscommunication often includes training structure, hours of operation, and pay increase. -Work Ethic Work ethic does not matter. It doesn’t matter how hard you work. State farm evaluates us by how much our manager likes us. That determines our raise, bonus, and promotional opportunities. -Metrics Metrics mean nothing. You can have the highest metrics and never be offered a promotion or any opportunities. -Abusive The environment is extremely abusive. In Retention 1 previously called the customer care center we had support groups to help one another cope with mental health after calls and regarding pay. We expect customer to be upset if there is an issue but Agents would call in just to verbally abuse us, call us names, and explain their racial superiority. Many of us applied to SFPP thinking with a higher position we wouldn't be verbally berated and belittled any more by agent and agent staff members. My training graduation class dropped from 40 to 12 after up to 1 year of abuse. Agents complain about us being back up but the abuse is why we are so short staffed. We get calls requesting things knowingly out of our scope and threats to make it happen or we will be reported to our manager(from agent and agent staff). No one cares that the request os out of scope or something solely the agents can do it still goes in our file. We are harassed and verbally abused daily and often times relentlessly. When reported nothing is done to hold them accountable making them feel more entitled to treat us badly. The abuse is so bad many of us have mental breakdown, heart attacks, and more at work causing us to be force on leave or quit (due to how it affects our physical health). -Pay Homelessness while working for corporate is ridiculous. When I worked entry level only those that were married, in a relationship, or working 2-3 jobs had enough income to qualify for housing in a 40 mile radius from the job. More than 90% of my team was homeless. Whether they couch hopped, stayed in room and board, or crashed with family. The pay does not match the living requirements or 3 times the rent anywhere. Working while homeless is stressful because you cant come to work and work you have to try to figure out life. Due to the miscommunication many lost their 2-3 job leading to the homelessness. -Resources Our scope updates daily but resources have not updated since 2017 efficiently creating gaps. So we are force to create our own resources or memorize everything. -Bullying I’ve witnessed manager be friends with those bullying and antagonizing others and punish the victim for being bullied in the workplace.",,x,o,o,3,3,1,1,1.0,5.0,Reviews/State-Farm-Reviews-E720093.htm,2023-03-17, SFPP Senior Account Representative,

2.0,Excessive overtime,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Health insurance, 401k, reasonable pay, consistent schedule (outside of the OT). And the tenured staff was very knowledgeable and helpful.","Overtime is constant and never ending. Leadership kept calling it ""non-optional additional hours"" anytime we called it overtime. But they knew what we meant. It was so hard to have balance because when I had a chance to rest, I was having to work my required overtime during that time. The overtime and constant micro-management caused my anxiety to be the worst it has ever been in my life. I quit 4 months ago and I'm still recovering from the burnout and anxiety. When I left, they were increasing the required overtime. There was constant micro-management. I was constantly reminded there was a report for everything I did, including my key strokes on my computer. And no matter what metrics I was meeting, there was always something I was getting hounded over- the number of calls I took in a week, or one task I completed. Didn't matter. There was always something they micro-managed us over. The hybrid schedule was awful. It was so much more stressful when I had to commute into office one week out of every 4 weeks. The decision to have a hybrid schedule was largely unpopular, from the CS's to even managers. It was clear the executive leadership teams were not listening to what the employees were saying. It was almost impossible to be able to take time off. You got PTO bids once every 6 months. And if you needed an extra day off after the bids, it was almost impossible to get it off. The availability to take time off was almost non-existent a huge majority of the time. So, if you needed a day off and it wasn't available, you 3 choices- find someone else who has the day of and see if they'll swap with you, try to see if your manager approves it manually (hopefully your reason is good enough for them), or you just call out. Quite frankly, I would not recommend anyone to work here. It's quite clear that the VPs who make decisions on staffing, do not care about their employees wellbeing and only care that they're making the profits they want to see. And it's apparent because they have a very high turnover rate. Partially because the training is not adequate for the demands of the job, and they are not doing enough to keep employees. There's a reason you'll see people tenured 20 years, and then people employed for a few months, and not a whole lot in between the 2. The new hires see it for what it is and leave. To explain how taxing this place of employment is- I had never regretted any day I called out, but regretted most days I logged in because of how miserable it made me to be there.",,x,x,x,2,3,1,1,2.0,4.0,Reviews/State-Farm-Reviews-E720093.htm,2023-03-01, PIP/MPC Claim Specialiat,

1.0,Worst job of all time,"Former Employee, less than 1 year","⬤Very good health insurance and other benefits 

⬤The work is never boring. It's... mentally stimulating

⬤Flex time on/off system so your week can be somewhat flexible, take a few hours off to go to a doctors appt. etc. and make up the hours later in the week. 

⬤My favorite parts of the job are reading police reports, looking up people's personal information on Accurint, and analyzing accident scenes on G streetview.

 ⬤My Section Manager was the nicest lady ever. The managers and peer-trainers I interacted with were generally nice and helpful.","⬤First of all, the training. The training was very long. 12 weeks total. The first few weeks are onboarding (filling out endless forms and HR training modules) and getting your license if you are in a licensed demand pool. Then it was about a month of all day zoom meetings which are part lecture and part doing modules on your own. It was tedious and boring, although sometimes they did try to make it engaging. Then they start you on working real claims. They do ease you into it which was nice. A few weeks where they manually assign you some simple claims, and then they move you onto ""phones"" (you take inbound phone calls for your demand pool, like a call center). The phone calls can be about literally anything, so it is really overwhelming. 


⬤Throughout your days, you will be assigned to either ""tasks"" or ""phones"". ""Phones"" is taking inbound calls and ""tasks"" can be a number of things, but it is the other way around - you are getting into claims directly, working the claim to the farthest point, and then only making outbound calls as needed. Most people prefer being on tasks because it is less stressful and easier to rack up your metrics. 

⬤After 12 weeks of training, you ""go live"". What they don't tell you in training is that you will be assigned on ""phones"" 90-100% of the time for the foreseeable future. 

⬤You have NO control over your daily schedule. Everything is planned out for you, including when you take your lunch and your 15-minute breaks. It varies every day so don't expect to always take lunch at exactly 12pm. It could be 11am on Tuesday and 1pm on Wednesday. Sometimes the schedule changes with literally a few minutes notice and they switched you from tasks to phones or vice versa. 

⬤It is like Big Brother, they track every minute of your activity and what's on your screen, if you go idle for 3 minutes they might be grilling you about it later. You need to try to ""adhere"" to your schedule as perfectly as possible because it's all tracked. Every day you get a spreadsheet and you can see your metrics (each highlighted in green, yellow, red for good/bad) compared to your peers. If you get wrapped up in a long phone call and can't take your break on time, that dings you. Of course it is much easier to have good ""adherence"" when you are on ""tasks"" and not stuck on ""phones"" all day. 

⬤I absolutely hated being on phones. It is like Russian Roulette. Sometimes you get a pleasant easy call. Sometimes you get someone screaming at you because they're unhappy with the liability decision. Sometimes you get someone screaming at you because another adjuster dropped the ball and no one has touched their claim in weeks. Sometimes you are the ""help desk"" for CAs in Express, which they are not supposed to treat you as but they do it anyway. Even worse is when the CAs ""cold transfer"" calls that don't belong to you because they know it's going to be a difficult call and they are too lazy to deal with it. Then they back out of the claim real fast so they don't get caught. This happens EVERY day. 

⬤A lot of CAs and ECRs (external claim resource, the independent contractors) are absolute imbeciles and they are a large part of why the CS Property-Complex job is a living hell. They mess up claims and you have to fix them. Don't get me wrong, a lot of CSs are not too bright either, so you will clean up their messes too. 

⬤Generally, this job values quantity over quality. People who rush through claims to click as many tasks as possible will have better metrics than people who take their time to do the job right. People will literally steal tasks from others and not actually do any productive work in the claim, but they will be rewarded with ""good metrics"" on the spreadsheet. They are literally treating it like a game. This is sad because real customers' lives can be messed with due to poor claim handling, but it's happening constantly. 

⬤If you want to take a vacation from all this madness, too bad. That PTO you accrued? You can't actually get it approved unless you plan 6 months in advance. There is a very convoluted and unfair PTO ""bidding"" system. I could write another novel.

You’re not allowed to have a life outside of State Farm, their company cones first. There’s no excuse for not doing overtime.

State Farm is saving millions and millions of dollars by not having building anymore in Colorado, no overhead, no electric bills, no Wi-Fi, no building maintenance or fees, but they don’t reimburse you for any of these bills you have at home, no internet or electric stipends and you also have to buy your own work desk and chair.",,o,o,o,1,1,1,1,1.0,1.0,Reviews/State-Farm-Reviews-E720093.htm,2023-02-27, Claims Specialist,

You can only request off on the first Wednesday of the month to take days off 6 mos in advance, nothing else. And you’ll have to work 3 holidays at random. They only acknowledge 5-6 holidays.

That’s it, from the time you log in until you log out. You are required to meet metric numbers no matter what. If not, you are placed on a performance plan.

1.0,DO NOT WORK HERE,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","Absolutely none. Zero. Not one. If I could give this company a negative star review for State Farm, I would give a negative star review, that's not an option, so one start it is.","Metrics: Overall, I've excelled at metrics, but some are problematic, the State Farm analysis of the 'data', is severely lacking. 1. The metrics are inaccurate due to the simplicity and inability to analyze data with relevant facts. 2. If an employee works overtime, the metrics are generic, counts the 'number of calls out' without taking into account, the associate worked a ton of over time. The result? The employee shows up on the 'call avoidant behavior report', and even though they are following protocols, have violated no rules, and are serving callers, the data simply fails to account for all of the OT, the associate will be warned, and if it continues, may face severe discipline. REREAD THAT. You read it right: I was going to be written up, even though the calls out were higher due to the significant amount of OT I was working, and that did not matter. 2. Hold times: You get in trouble if hold times are too long, and many times we have no control, especially if you are working at night, when the State Farm tech team is handled by Sitel, and there are only like 7 people. Again, not avoiding work, not putting people on hold unless necessary, yet warned, threatened with discipline, because the company loses money if people are on hold. KEEP DEPARTMENTS STAFFED AND THIS WILL NOT HAPPEN. Break schedules suck, it's not related to call volume as they care, and the do not care how poorly timed the breaks are, because State Farm does not care. When you read the required verbatim word tract which contains 'unavailable', you may be reprimanded, for making the company look bad. Happened to me more than once. We are to avoid saying we cannot help and are told to say what we can do. There are many scenarios our only option is to send a message to the agent, we do not make the rules, we simply have to follow them. In these situations, there are many times callers are extremely angry, and refuse to accept the information we provide. After telling a caller ?I can send a message to the agent"" and ""I understand you really want _____, the best way I can help you, is to send a message to the agent"" and I hear this is very important and I need to send a message to the agent so they can assist you"" and "" I can hear your frustration and I wish I could ____, this is something only the agent can assist you with"", the policy holder said ""So you can't help me"", I said ""Correct"", they asked again and I finally said, ""No, I cannot help you, I can send a message to the agent"" and was given a shield, the most severe form of discipline outside of firing an employee. I LITERALLY followed State Farm protocol, and to transfer them to another department, results in a hold time (remember you get dinged for calling out and a long hold time = a double ding - no need to do that) for a refused the call or said ""I'm just going to tell them the same thing "". Additionally, a transfer like that, leads to push back and fighting to get someone to take a call they can do nothing about. REREAD THIS: I was threatened with severe discipline for doing my job multiple times and was written up for doing my job - all of this started after an extended leave of absence. State Farm will harass, bully, threaten, and berate you. They retaliate and discriminate. The way they handle FMLA, ADA and short term disability is absolutely horrible and often deprives the employee of the time designated for any of the above due to the excessive amount of time resolving problems with the above. When an employee uses their breaks, lunches, and time after work trying to deal with FMLA, Short Term Disability or ADA, there is a problem. When issues related to the above deprives the employee this time because it is taken making calls to three different entities and multiple departments within each entity, something is wrong. When an employee is traumatized after being threatened, warned, and harassed following their return to State Farm after an extended leave for medical health, and develops a Panic Disorder, is ambushed and blindsided with a shield for saying ""I cannot help you"", and cannot pull herself together in the 10 minutes she has been given due to a severe panic attack, only to be harassed later for not being able to return to the phones within 10 minutes, and is threatened with additional discipline for being unable to communicate and NOT being on the phones due to the panic attack. THERE IS A PROBLEM. State Farm has a high suicide rate, it is not uncommon, it is not talked about, it does not prompt change. A company that cares would work to improve, this has gone on for decades, and State Farm continues to do nothing.",,x,x,x,1,1,1,1,1.0,,Reviews/State-Farm-Reviews-E720093.htm,2023-02-01, Retention Specialist,

1.0,Not good at all,Former Employee,"Benefits can be ok, but most are not","Unrealistic expectations. If customers or agents want to know why they constantly have problems with their policies its because when you want something changed 1. Agents don't know what they are doing half the time. 2. Agents don't understand the products. 3. Agents always try to find the best way to line their pockets even knowing they are committing insurance fraud in the process. 4. SF allows us about 2 minutes to complete changes to accounts. Constantly changing cases per hour and touches per hour. If you don't hit the goals of the day of around 350 households in a day, you get talked to about your performance. Oh and you have to find ways to minupulate the 1960's software they use just to get changes completed. Can't spend the needed time to do everything 100% correct in order to keep your production numbers up. You definitely can't use the PTO they give you when you want to use it, since all PTO requests go through a system and if the system does not show hours left you get denied. Or you have to cut your vacation short because if you take a vacation and maybe Thursday does not have any hours left your PTO is denied. The PTO you earn is at a snails pace. After 4 months you might be able to take a week off. You better feel good the whole day. If you become sick during your shift guess what it goes into unapproved time off, same goes for if you wake up sick. Better plan your illnesses at least 24 hours ahead of time or you will have unapproved time off. If you make a mistake for what ever reason and it could be even your first-time your manager will target you over and over to the point of stress and your numbers decline just enough so they give you a write up and then pretty much your job will come to an end. Once on a shield/write up your bonus is gone, you can't post out for something else or move up, and of course they will no longer pay for your college education. They have management that has never worked on the crappy system, so they have no idea what issues you really run into. They have this peer to peer feedback tool, that if you make a mistake and someone else has to fix it, and then they will give you feedback and you can get into trouble if you get a few a month. The problem is it can take longer to fill out the feedback, then it takes to fix the error. Most of the time it's petty stuff, and you're judged by the amount of feedback you send out to others, so you run into a problem where people just want to pad their numbers just to look better themselves. Don't believe them when they say getting them doesn't hurt you...it does! People in your own group will send them to you also instead of just shooting a message to you about it. When sending them out you don't even have to have supporting documents to help you out, so you have to dig through tons of documents to see where you went wrong. Speaking of documents they give you only a little of what you need to know, then you will need to go through a million different sources to find what you need. Ugh so much documents of you also better be quick, remember the 2 minutes.",,x,x,x,2,2,1,3,1.0,2.0,Reviews/State-Farm-Reviews-E720093.htm,2023-01-07, Underwriting Assistant,

5.0,Best Insurance Agency I've Ever Worked For,Current Employee,"The company is structured well, you advise people of products that can be of service to them personally by getting to know them. This is not somewhere you just try to sell everything you can to everyone who walks through the door or calls in on the phone. The company has an anonymous tip line, if you want to suggest where things can be better they take them seriously and follow up with you for more information if you don't enter it anonymously. You don't have to have experience, they will get you licensed and the training program is very in-depth. I never feel like there is anything that I either don't know how to do or don't know how to find the resources to figure out. This is the first workplace I've ever felt like could be a long-term career for me. Every day I wake up for work genuinely thankful that I have this position and I don't ever feel like I wish I didn't work here. Everyone is inviting and there isn't the annoying chargebacks and cold-calling. Even the marketing that you do is fun. I could not recommend a career at this company any stronger.","Honestly there's very little I can say I don't like about the company.

Arrangements for lodging and transportation for training were made well in advance which ensured there were no last minute issues to contend with. From the moment I arrived for training, I was treated like family and everyone made it a friendly atmosphere to be in. I feel like I am part of something great, and look forward to this journey with Acceptance.","The training was very thorough and showed all aspects of what the job will entail. While it was a lot to intake at once, I was at least able to see it before starting the job. As with most jobs, using all the computer systems required to perform the job will require repetition to become familiar with those systems.

I have never made more than minimum wage and am used to living cheaply. I wanted to do work that made the world a better place. After reflection, I have realized no amount of idealism can taper the financial anxiety of being paid a non-livable wage. you are likely replacing a full-time staff member- they are milking as much work as they can from you for free. I made it work by living in an affordable place, splitting bills, and being frugal. But my self-worth is really being called into question as to the amount of labor I am doing just to come home and be financially ruined by car maintenance. you need to use your personal car for this job, depends on the site but they require it to work which is a barrier to poor people the AmeriCorps supervisor for the network is kind of incompetent, didn't realize it at first but I get the impression now they're mostly just checking boxes, not so much of a strong leader and not plugged into our personal development. The trainings they picked for us are often bogus, like insultingly stupid. I feel like as college graduates and grandparents and people getting masters we should be treated as adults. They made us sign a ""group agreement"" that none of us helped type up, which is not a group agreement but a contract. the limitations of AmeriCorps sometimes make it harder to be effective in our role and I think that the host site suffers a bit from having a new person every year",,x,r,o,4,1,3,5,5.0,3.0,Reviews/AmeriCorps-Reviews-E378470.htm,2023-01-14, Member,

1.0,Toxic workplace with incompetent management style,"Current Employee, more than 5 years",Private healthcare 10 days paid sick leave Discount above market standard Training on product knowledge and clienteling,"Low commission structure - decreased significantly since LVMH takeover and all bonuses were removed. Employee benefits and well-being practices non-existent - company used to host yearly conferences, Christmas parties, holiday gifting, and incentives. These have all been removed without explanation despite the explanation being clear. The company has gone from offering luxury experiences and gifting to nothing. Annual Leave limitations - no allowance during November - January. History of not allowing employees to take or carry on their legally accrued holiday allowance during times of lockdown. Micromanagement and lack of proper communication skills from management teams across the business. Many store managers are simply inexperienced and incredibly passive aggressive towards their client advisors. Majority of employees are also too scared to bring these issues to attention due to justified concerns over retaliation. Favouritism - top sellers receive significantly better treatment by management in matters as simple as attitude expressed towards them. Being on receiving end of either one is incredibly uncomfortable. High turnover of employees - at joining, the brand was filled with loyal and tenured employees, it has since managed those employees out of the business and new hires are only lasting 6 months on average due to poor working conditions and lack of good pay. Every employee I know is or has considered changing workplaces. Unreasonable expectations - such as reprimands for not checking work phone / communications on days off (not only unreasonable but also illegal). Expectations of serving clients back to back for hours without breaks for drink or bathroom. When taken, those small breaks are timed and managers are known to pressure employees into returning to the shop floor. I have witnessed managers following employees to the bathrooms on numerous occasions. Lack of care - personal circumstances are irrelevant and unimportant to the business. I have seen employees reprimanded and placed on disciplinary measures for matters such as long term sicknesses, homelessness, and family issues. HR team which is neither human nor resourceful - reps are incredibly condescending and only speak in formulaic terms without providing any real answers or solutions. The only competent HR Manager left the business. Incompetent Customer Service team - providing very contradictory and incorrect information to clients which then has to be corrected in store. They create more customer complaints than they resolve. Despite enormous amounts of feedback they do not acknowledge fault or improve. Lack of consistency - company policies are not adhered to. Managers authorise complimentary services the moment they lose control over a client issue. This undermines all the work a client advisor puts in to explain policies such as repair charges. Company policies regarding in-store operations are also not adhered. Matters which are strictly to be performed by management are delegated to other members of staff. Hiring outside of the business - the company is incredibly reluctant to promote employees and provide employees with the tools they need to progress. They predominantly hire outsiders for management roles. Unfortunately, these hires are not only unfamiliar with the business but very rude and lacking reasonable management style. Salary increase rates more than halved during the pandemic. Severe inconsistency in salaries across the business also. The company is more than able to create a tiered salary system and yet has not done so.",,x,x,x,1,2,1,1,1.0,2.0,Reviews/Tiffany-&-Co.-Reviews-E663.htm,2023-02-19, Client Advisor,

1.0,Worst organization with no job security.,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",The only benefit of working here was that you were paid on time and nothing else.,"There is nothing about this organization that makes worth working here. I was hired as a full-time employee and after 3 months of joining I was allocated to a project, but I was not billed and still remained non billable which caused me a lot of issues and after 9 months of employment I was told that they have to release me from the project and have to look for other projects in the organization soon. One fine day I was asked to join a manager discussion call where I was told that the organization is planning to release me because I was on bench for so long. I was tagged to a project but I was marked as non-billable which according to the company is considered as bench and so I have to leave the organization. On 22/02/2023 I received a mail from my HR for 1-1 discussion where they asked me to resign or else, they will terminate me and will also not be given experience letter. I was not the only one who is into this. More than 35% of the work force is getting layed off but it's not on paper as they are asking the employees to resign from their end so that is don't reflect in the termination count. I got 0 learning from this organization and also there is no job security for the employees in the organization. Not only freshers but also the senior employees are also facing the same situation. So, I would like to conclude that I would never recommend anyone to join this organization even in their worst phase no one is safe in this company. I also saw total mismanagement in the organization as when I joined the organization there were two employees with the same name as mine and we both had different employee IDs but were give the same work mail because of which I faced a lot of issues during the onboarding phase. This is the worst organization I have ever seen and worked in.

There is no training they make you watch a bunch of videos and then throw you on the floor with the same draw as everyone else. The culture is competitive and unfriendly. Many people got in fights on the floor in front of customers for “stealing sales”. Unless you are part of the 5th ave Club, the upper management doesn’t care about you. Merchandise was damaged all the time. The shipping department didn’t package my sales properly multiple times and that causes you to get a return even though it’s not your fault. Some associates stand outside of the boutiques so they can pretend the customer walking in is theirs. Almost every brand is going leased so it’s 10X harder for a saks associate to sell. They don’t give you work phones so you have to give everyone your personal number and I’ve been harassed on my day off by clients.",,x,o,x,1,1,1,2,1.0,2.0,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Saks-Fifth-Avenue-Stores-SFA-Reviews-E2963.htm,2023-01-15, Client Advisor,

Voicing your frustrations won’t help as you are their slave. The attitudes in here are the worst and possible the worst company I have worked for. Team of four managers and each and every one with the exception of 1 are insufferable. They could care less about you and more about their overgrown glorified money making babies. Granted, that is how the fashion industry is to be expected. The stereotypes are valid in the environment. Hard work for little pay. The faker you are the better. Take on this role like an acting opportunity and be as fake as possible to reach the top!

Everyone is overworked, with low-end salary and bonuses compared to other companies. - Policies applied unequally to leadership vs employees. Some people are allowed to come in once a month, while other departments adhere strictly to the 3 days in/2 out WFH policy. - Unethical practices. Mid-managers and leadership coming in sick to office while COVID positive. Leadership discriminates against employees for taking leave time. - Favoritism runs rampant - Minimal room for advancement. Education and growth opportunities have to be approved by management, which is often rejected due to ""high workload"". - Huge lack of diversity and programs around promoting diversity. HR wants to hire people with diverse backgrounds, but does not listen to them when offering advice on how to build a more inclusive environment.",,x,v,r,2,3,3,1,2.0,1.0,Reviews/Weyerhaeuser-Reviews-E730.htm,2023-01-24, Anonymous Employee,

Employees can take on challenging roles, acquire new skills, and advance in their careers. Employee Benefits: Flipkart provides a comprehensive range of employee benefits, including competitive salaries, performance bonuses, healthcare coverage, and employee discounts on products. Innovative Work Culture: Flipkart fosters a culture of innovation and encourages employees to think creatively, experiment, and contribute ideas. This can lead to exciting and rewarding work experiences.

1.0,CSA,"Former Employee, less than 1 year",Nothing is good there so don't go,"Tech Mahindra, don't ever go there. Never, ever. If you don't trust me, just go and see for yourself. When you go to any bathroom section, you will find a person abusing the Tech Mahindra Flipkart process, whether they are new or old. I work as a CSA there, and there are so many issues in the voice process. It's the worst in terms of salary, timing, system, chair, and most importantly, cab allocation. Cabs are allocated during night or early day shifts, mostly from your home to the company. Sometimes, cab drivers may leave you and mark you absent in the app. After three absences, you will have to pay 500 Rs. And even when you try to raise the issue, they don't want to solve it. The most important thing is that when you are selected after three rounds of interviews, after waiting for the whole day, they will tell you to come back another day. And before that, they will have you sign a paper for the night shift. Mostly, they will not inform you that you will be paid only 300 per day during training. I was also not informed about this, and the training will be a minimum of 40 days. You will have to buy headphones with your own money. Salary is the most significant issue here. They don't want to pay even your training amount, and then the trainer will say something to you, and then a new trainer will say another thing. Coffee is free in the cafeteria, but one day a friend of mine found some insects in the coffee. Thank God I didn't drink from there. If you want to destroy your life, then surely go and check. Every person working there will tell you about these issues. The managers only exaggerate and do nothing. They have no interest at all in resolving your issues. They come every day and threaten that you will be expelled for this and that, and give empty warnings. They also mention that you will not be paid if you do certain things.",,x,x,x,1,1,1,1,1.0,1.0,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Flipkart-Reviews-E300494.htm,2023-06-22, Customer Service Associate (CSA),

1.0,Pathetic Work Culture,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",1) Only salary comes on time.,"1) No working time mentioned in offer letter, hence they seek 24 x 7 availability. 2) No work-life balance. You can expect a call almost any day and at any time. 3) Gender bias, nepotism, indiscipline, favourism, cajoling. 4) No knowledge transfer, no training provided after joining, its a joke in the name of induction. 5) Beauty over brains is given preference. If you are a beautiful girl, your job is almost guaranteed and on top of that if you smile, laugh and joke around with your manager, you are the best employee who is going to get all kinds of benefits. 6) You should not be surprised if you find your manager to be an absolte worthless creature. 7) There is lots of politics, even HRs are involved in the same. 8) Especially if you join a zonal or a regional office, mental torture is almost guaranteed 9) Not picking phone on a sunday or even if you are on leaves is a crime and will have to answer the same. 10) A senior manager expects me to carry laptop to the hospital if I have taken a leave for taking my parents for checkup to the doctor. 11) If you fall ill, make sure you are doing your work otherwise you can expect a call from your senior manager asking you about why the work has not been done instead of asking about your health. 12) You can also expect to get transferred all of a sudden without any prior information, for which you may not even be reimbursed, even after HRs promise. 13) Even Job KRA is not defined and they can make you work on anything. 14) No criticism or honest feedback is encouraged. If you speak your mind, you will be an outcaste and can certainly expect it is going to affect your ratings and hence your salary increment. 15) No transparency. 16) There are lots of policies and benefits which are shared over e-mails but none is implemented on ground. Even the HR ignores the same. 17) Working in flipkart will make you feel as if you are hired as a labour doing anything and everything at any time without any break. Then only you are a good employee. If you work for 8 hours and not after that you are an irresponsible employee who is not taking work seriously! 18) Zoanl and Regional offices are more of call centers if nothing else.",,x,x,x,1,2,1,1,1.0,2.0,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Flipkart-Reviews-E300494.htm,2023-02-16, Executive,

Honestly, that was the most significant draw for me. Everyone here was - and still is - SO willing to help with anything I needed. Also, in my particular role and with all the company acquisitions, there is a wide range of products/projects to work on; from hoists to conveyors to actuators to test fixtures. I've learned an immense amount about these different product fields in my relatively short time here and there's still so much to learn. The ""old guard"" is very knowledgeable and so willing to share their expertise and knowledge. Management has also made a huge effort to be more transparent and open about the business as a whole to showcase the goals we're working towards and our efforts at reaching them. An all-around interesting and pleasant place to work!","The downside to all the acquisitions and working between the brands is not having a single ""way to do things"". Going from project to project sometimes feels like learning to walk over and over again. As soon as you think you understand the structure and practices of the brand you're working with, another project with a different brand comes along and you're re-learning/re-adjusting to fit a different set of processes.

- Inflexibility. Successful companies realize when something isn't working. If they fail, they fail quickly and pivot. CMCO plows straight ahead with failed systems and processes, continuously throwing, time, money and manpower at issues to no avail. Change occurs much slower than it should/needs to in order to remain competitive.  


- Meetings. Related to the ineptitude are the endless meetings. The company seems to correlate meetings with progress, when in fact the opposite is occurring. One problem typically equals seven meetings and zero solutions. 


- Poor Delegation. Delegation is critical for successful management... That said, everyone I've worked with in an upper management position is ignorant to what is going on under them. I'm not being hyperbolic - I can't think of one exception. It's a systemic issue. They pass off responsibility and hope the person they've delegated to knows what they're doing (and they usually don't).

These comments are specific to Clinical Research within Mayo Clinic. Clinical research at Mayo is fairly dysfunctional. Most of the research leadership are from the Rochester area and have never worked outside of Mayo Clinic. The organization is very top heavy, with way too many managers looking to justify their salary by making up unnecessary policies and programs ultimately preventing investigators and study teams from doing actual research. This results in highly bureaucratic culture where feedback is not welcome. A rigid (almost military) hierarchy ensures that information flows through gatekeepers so nobody is held accountable.

You no longer can just be promoted for working hard, there has to be a business justification and then the position will be posted for everyone to apply for. This means you have a bunch of coworkers scratching and clawing their way up. The result is people hoarding work, backstabbing others to make themselves look better and sucking up to anyone in a position that will help them get promoted. If you do get the “promotion”, you’ll still be making far less than others in the same industry. They say their health insurance is top notch, but it is far from that.

Also, using it was an issue. In the summer months, only five consecutive days of PTO could be approved. You may not even get all five days approved because it’s based on seniority and certain number of people taking off and if a certain day is already at a max for people taking off, you will get denied. I asked for 5 days for a trip and only had 4 days approved. I ended up leaving Mayo 6 wks before my vacation for a job that gave me the full week paid. Tuition reimbursement was also non-existent. Employees were very overworked and overwhelmed during the pandemic. Half the staff were furloughed for the summer while the remaining half of us did the work of the full department.

Your fellow technicians are unwilling to provide efficient support and will not take accountability for any mistakes - leaving you to fix and correct all their mistakes. ALL upper management works FROM HOME - they do not see your day to day so they will expect you to complete 50 other tasks at the same time and to prioritize their needs over yours. 
They will expect you to train new employees without any guidance - you basically make up the training contents and how you train employees since no one supervises you - there is no standard procedure for most of the work you do so you make it up as you go. This causes major inconsistencies within departments. 
The turnover rate for this department is extremely high. There has not been a time where this department has been fully staffed. Some colleagues can be rude and start unnecessary drama.

2.0,work load insanely high and pay is very low,"Former Employee, more than 5 years","Most of the customers were great and for the main part of my employment, I loved my co-workers. When I was an assistant I loved loved my manager we became great friends and have remained friends even after we both have left. A lot of my clothes came from there if not all. I did like the layaway program, especially with the employee discounts I could get new clothes and accessories cheap. Some of the clothes would be ugly but there were a lot of great finds when we got new shipments.","The higher ups DO NOT care about the employees. When I first started as a 2nd assistant full time I made 20 cents above minimum wage. Getting promoted to 1st assistant I received maybe a dollar. Then as an SM I was salary and found out later I was drastically underpaid compared to other SMs even though we were one the Highest grossing stores. When I took over as SM I literally had 1 employee due to people getting fired or leaving due to school etc. I had to hire an entire staff. I begged for additional training hours and was told no. I was salary so I was working from open to close most days with no breaks. pre pandamic working hours were 9:30 am to 9:30 pm. We did not get lunch breaks for a long time until one day they did instill them after an incident in another state. But prior to that me and some other managers worked open to close no breaks. I was involved with an employee at a different location. We did not work in the same store... The DM at the time found out about the relationship and decided to spread my personal business everywhere. I ended up walking out due to being mentally, spiritually, and physically exhausted after an encounter with an employee. I asked for help and got nothing. I asked for better training and got nothing. I was expected to hold down the entire store with no back-up. Not recommended to anyone who is looking to break into the fashion business. When we used to interview people we were instructed to put comments on people's applications about how they looked. If someone wasn't ""cute"" or had the wrong look we were to put no or something negative about their appearance. The DM even made comments about my appearance later on down the road after I had been there 2+ years. The work load is insane.

Was $9.00 hr (updated new minimum wage $11.00hr) for entry level warehouse shipping position. With NO chance for a raise. If you do end up sticking it out and moving up to the receiving department. It’s was a raise to $10.00 hr. (Updated wage $11.50-$12.00 hr) If you do eventually get the opportunity to advance you will be lowballed with a lower advancement wage then the previous employee. Warehouse conditions are bad. Warehouse is filthy. Heat inside the warehouse climbs up to 95+ degrees. I’ve seen fellow employees collapse due to heat exhaustion. Most warehouse positions start at $15.00-$16.00 an hour with the opportunity of a raise after at least a year. But not at Sam Ash. The warehouse technology is outdated and far behind their competitors. Falling apart computers and printers. Inventory scanning equipment is over twenty years old. Shipping department has no technology to help shippers or the company pick, pack and ship correct inventory. Corporate management tries to control everything besides its own issues. Lack of accountability and communication. Upper and corporate management looks down on the employees. The health plans provided once you are eligible are a joke. They don’t cover much of anything and cost the employee a lot. Sam Ash has an environment that sucks the life out of its employees. There is much more to say here. But I will leave it at this.",,x,x,x,1,1,1.0,1,1.0,2.0,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Sam-Ash-Reviews-E4368.htm,2023-03-21, Warehouse Supervisor,

The team had to explain why this was inappropriate and had him take it down. Later, he claimed to be 'passionate about fighting for Black and Brown communities'. He speaks over women, contradicts what we say, and refuses to take any of our feedback - all the while claiming he cares and is here for us and saying we should 'come to him with any problems'.

The company showed a pattern of moving toxic or unproductive people from team to team but never actually addressing the performance or potential harassment issues. I also had terrible experiences with clients and nothing was done by Booz. The work on most projects is slow and inefficient.

Booz isn't able to manage the contracts well and causes the customer to lose trust with the firm. Booz will convince you take a TechEx course which will put you $5k into debt and have to wait 18 month to be debt free. This is their strategy in maintaining their employees as turnover is high at the firm.  The salary is way below market average compared to what other companies pay.  When you leave a project and go to the bench to find a new project, you're essentially on your own. There is very little help from your CM.

You're always going to have to work hard, put in the time and energy, and invest in your career, but where Booz Allen differs, compared to others, is that people have your back.

1.0,Avoid if you work in Intelligence,Former Employee,None that I know of.,"I only worked at Booz for about 6 months, and it was mostly a negative experience for me. I started as a Senior Consultant which I felt was lower than what I should have been. This is considering I had 7 years work experience and a masters degree while I know of people with only a undergrad degree and less than 3 years experience that got hired as a Senior Consultant and promoted to Associate after only 2 years. My manager also wasn't good, he didn't care, he had already told me he himself was trying to be moved to a different contract. So, anything that has to do with me was an extra chore that just needed to be done. Then, when it started looking like he would be leaving, he started off loading more of his chores as a manger onto me while they waited for a new person to replace him and pick up where he left off. The tuition reimbursement isn't good, its 7k per year, but after completing your course, and this is every time you use the tuition assistance, you incur a 2 year commitment to Booz, where if you leave within 1 year after completing your course, you have to pay back the money, and if you leave within the second year, you pay back half the cost for the tuition. Some things that were more personal to me, but still factored into me wanting to leave: when I gave Booz by ballpark range for my salary, not only did they not meet me somewhere in my ballpark, but they actually offered 5k less than the bottom rung. My ballpark wasn't high to begin with, and the only reason I took the offer is that I was tired of my current job. My commute was also terrible - 1 to 1.5 hours each way. Other than this, I've just seen in general that intelligence analysts get treated like trash at this company compared to other career fields such as cyber, software, data, etc. So unless you belong to one of those fields, you should keep moving.",,x,r,x,1,1,1,1,2.0,2.0,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Booz-Allen-Hamilton-Reviews-E2735.htm,2023-04-08, Intelligence Analyst,

4.0,Young Professionals Beware,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","Everyone I've worked with both on the government and BAH teams have been super nice, reliable, willing to teach, and always glad to cover or step in if needed. It's easy to change roles/fields if you're not feeling challenged or engaged by your current work. I've gone from DoD to DOE to HHS and met so many great people and learned a lot so that's cool. Most contracts have a great WLB and leaders are always available and willing to talk if you have questions or concerns. The SA on my current contract is FANTASTIC, he's demanding but always accommodating and gives great feedback and accepts criticism well.","It feels like you're punished if you're good at what you do and you're young. This was my first job out of college (22) and I've been here for 4 years. I worked really hard to be billable the entire time (I've been on 3 different contract), I've been engaged on the internal BAH side with account councils and proposals, and I got a M.S. in Cybersecurity M&P but I've had promotions declined and raise requests watered down because I'm a younger employee. My most recent promotion request was denied because in the words of my manager ""I was doing such a great job in my new role on a very demanding contract but we just want to see you do it longer!"" If I was a 35 year old man would the whole ""doing something for longer"" have come into play when considering my promotion? Booz wants to shift to a young and hungry tech consulting environment but aren't willing to put younger more ambitious employees in a position to succeed and want to stay at the firm. Not to say they won't use your talents and skills on a contract for a client because they def will but when it comes time to pay/promote you on the internal side your age almost certainly plays a part for whatever reason.",,o,r,o,5,2,4,4,3.0,5.0,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Booz-Allen-Hamilton-Reviews-E2735.htm,2023-03-25, Business Analyst,

1.0,Avoid at all costs. Horrible experience.,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",Absolutely no pros that I can think of.,"Throughout my 3 year tenure I left the company extremely disappointed with my experience. I had high hopes when joining the firm originally. I worked for a notoriously difficult Navy client in San Diego, CA in PMW (program office) 120 but left with a bad taste in my mouth from my treatment by my own internal team as well. You do not get a choice in determining which program office or team you are placed in. If you are not assigned to a team outright you will be placed on the “bench” for a maximum of one month while they look for opportunities for you and will be forced to resign if there are no open billets. This also applies when your contract ends with your client. If you have the unfortunate luck to have a client-facing role you will be in tricky territory from the beginning - most of the government clients are absolutely miserable people to work with. They are extremely demanding, condescending, stuck in their bureaucratic old ways, do not know how to communicate effectively and will demean you behind your back any chance they get. You should expect ZERO support from your Booz Allen management and leadership when you face these challenges with your client. The company only cares about keeping the client happy often at your expense. This is something a colleague had brought up during a team meeting to management in my first week on the job and I wish I had listened at the time. Of course leadership pays lip service during all internal meetings and pretends to care about their employees and advocating for the company values but it’s all crap. My team was a revolving door and I was the last person standing that was relatively new to the firm. Myself as well as some others in my team (whom are all gone) asked management for guidance and support and a path to promotion but were met with outright hostility during our annual reviews. Other program offices were the same according to stories I heard from the many people who have resigned. You will be assigned a so-called “career manager” which is nothing more than a glorified supervisor whom will do little to nothing to provide you training or real support with clients. Peer reviews are discouraged and there is very much a “sink or swim” mentality. Expect to be cutthroat in your dealings with others and play office politics to the extreme OR stay with the company for 5+ years to get promoted to the level that you want. Working for Booz allows no creativity in your approach to your daily work and you will be expected to fully conform to client and firm demands day in and day out. If you are client facing you will be expected to report to the government on site location whenever your client demands you to, with no exception. If you are located in San Diego you will be expected to report to NAVWAR in downtown San Diego which is a run down and rat-infested WW1 facility with claustrophobic cubicles for contractors. Contractors are not even allowed to park on site. Lastly, the pay at Booz Allen is shockingly low compared to the other big 3 and even top 10 firms in the country. Additionally, I did not see any others receive bonuses and the annual merit increase was below the national average for many. For a firm this large and profitable the health benefits were disappointing and I found myself spending a lot out of pocket for my health care. Most other employees I had confidential conversations with throughout my tenure were also unhappy with their experience at the firm and were actively looking for other jobs with better pay and a better working environment. Save yourself the trouble and work at the many other consulting firms out there where you will be paid what you deserve and will be supported.",,x,x,x,1,1,1,1,1.0,2.0,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Booz-Allen-Hamilton-Reviews-E2735.htm,2023-02-28, Anonymous Employee,

1.0,Pricing here is……interesting.,Former Employee,They have a solid training program in pricing which is a good way to meet some coworkers.,"Where do I begin? The work here is chaotic and sporadic. You will get proposals sprung up on you out of thin air with outrageous deadlines, forcing you to work late nights, weekends, cancel any dinner plans, even vacations you’ve planned. The people within pricing are so accustomed to working well over 40 hours plus weekends that they don’t even make a fuss about it. They simply take it as “part of the job”. Newsflash, have a backbone and stand your ground without letting program management dictate unreasonable timelines for you. Having worked as a pricer at other places, this is by far the worst company for work life balance. Pricerscof all levels (Sr. Consultants, Associates, Lead Associates, etc.) can easily work till 7pm/8pm each night. Booz Allen is so cheap that they are always understaffed, especially in pricing. Another thing is the bureaucracy and red tape. There are more tedious rules to follow and you will get dinged on the most minute details that are not even pricing related by the internal audit team. This affects you as it goes on your metrics. The managers here are also hit and miss. Some are decent and some will belittle you. I’ve seen it and been part of it myself during my time here. Another thing is “off” Fridays. The company is trying to switch to a 9/80 schedule but it is not even real as you’re basically “on call” your entire Friday and have to be within minutes of Wi-Fi signal during your “off” day. During my time, I was called on most of my off Fridays, essentially making the 9/80 benefit worthless. Other things to mention is you will get paid once every 4 weeks (instead of 2 weeks) until that policy goes away in late 2023 and their healthcare benefits were the worst compared to other companies I’ve worked at. They have a free healthcare option but don’t opt for it unless you are never sick. Otherwise, prepared to pay a hefty price out-of-pocket.",,o,o,o,,,,,,,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Booz-Allen-Hamilton-Reviews-E2735.htm,2023-02-08, Pricing Analyst,

1.0,Do Not Work Here At All Costs,"Current Employee, less than 1 year","Literally nothing, they haven't done a single thing correct during my time here.","Where to start? Maybe I could start with how atrocious onboarding the company is. Put simply, nobody cares enough to assist and answer the most basic of questions and you have to figure out the steps by yourself. There is no path to follow, no instructions to read. Just figure it out yourself. Next, Onboarding to a project. So you managed to onboard to the company, nice! Get ready to get completely and utterly ignored by the staff opps department as you read outdated instructions with links to sites and documents no longer working. For an example, once you painstakingly find a project, you then on average have to wait 3-4 MONTHS before you can realistically expect to be onboarded and charge time to the project. Once on the project, don't expect work or tasks to get you through the day, as you won't have access to any of the systems. To get those you need to go back through the staff opps department. At this point you'd be better off sending staff opps your resignation letter as they might actually get around to that by the time you get a promotion at your new company. Next, the people. Everybody Understands how broken the company is, but nobody does anything to fix it. Nobody knows the processes to get anything, and if the little knowledge they do have doesn't work, then you're just screwed. I've spent about a year at the company at this point, my recommendation is that if you get offered a job here go on the zoom to laugh in their face.

This created a ton of new opportunities at Infor as they grew from 5,000 teammates to 15,000 over that time frame. A ton of exciting roles were created for everyone that was part of the journey. And they pivoted the company from less than $1 in SAAS to $1B in SAAS within 5 years. Prior to that, the head of Cloud ran services for SAP North America. And prior to that, the CEO and his right hands took Retek public in 1999. They are putting an emphasis on customer experience, and growth.

2.0,Change too fast and you forfeit your potential,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","Blue Yonder has truly some of the most innovative and kind people I have ever worked with. On top of that, when I initially joined, office politics seemed relatively low. You could schedule meetings with just about anyone, and people were really open to collaboration. Pay and benefits are good. Time off is good. Today, we have a brand new leadership team (for the most part), that in the past 9 months, have done very little to communicate, add clarity or gain the trust of our associates. While the proven track record is admirable, every company is different. What worked for one company, may not work for another. We still have a lot of support through Associate Success, Wellbeing programs and flexible time off (not to be confused with other reviews that suggest ""unlimited time off.""). Still, very gracious for the amount of time off given. Despite the change, Blue Yonder is always open to ideas, innovation and transformation. I do have hope for the future, and am excited about our mission every day I come to work. The supply chain is one of the most important aspects to our world, and so being able to make a positive impact on that is fantastic.","I think there is a level of pride that the new leadership team has because of their past success, that has created a barrier to listening, and being open to changing their ideas from what worked with another company, to what will actually work here at Blue Yonder. Additionally, we are all strapped thin on resources. We are consistently losing people, and being asked to do way more with way less. Everyone right now is feeling extreme burnout, and change fatigue. Change Management principles only work when we are also strategic about ""how much"" change we do all at once. In this case, I think we are changing too much too quickly, that regardless of how effective we are at change management, we are hurting ourselves in the process. Overall, our leadership team seems to have good ideas, and are asking great questions. But failing to not only communicate clearly, but also being open to admitting mistakes. Our new team has yet to ""own"" making a mistake, or acted in transparency to how little they have communicated. This makes me not trust their heart for our associates or care for the organization. A lot of our initiatives are focused on efficiency, which often transforms individualistic ideas to numbers. What was once a great culture when I joined many years ago, is turning into an organization that I struggle to stay with or believe in.",,x,v,o,2,4,2,2,2.0,3.0,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Blue-Yonder-Reviews-E6191.htm,2023-03-16, Anonymous Employee,

5.0,A great place to grow together,"Current Employee, more than 5 years","Many of you are probably first concerned with benefits, and well, yes they are amazing. Next, you'll want to know what the workload is like. Fruitful. Nothing you do here is for, nothing. Every idea, act of service, or time you put into your work goes towards the mission. Employee appreciation is an area Medifast has prioritized and will continue to. As well, diversity in leadership has improved. There is a strong culture being developed here and it creates opportunities each year. You will be well fed. They have an EAP program that is reliable and resourceful, take advantage of that. Teamwork is an essential piece to this community. If you enjoy working with others you will enjoy Medifast. Medifast has an extraordinarily flexible scheduling system for work. You do receive a bonus. A lot of diversity in leadership. We have some strong and intelligent men and women from many cultures. Hashtag #BlackLeadership Our CEO is incredibly lively and rarely appears stressed or worried. And, if you are a potential employee who cares about the progress of the company they are going to work for that can be reassuring. Believe me. He is always smiling. Our President is an amazing dancer and also enjoys people. If you are wondering what that has to do with working here? Dancing is an activity that requires one to have coordination, confidence, and the courage to jump out there and get involved. There are always ups and downs but when you need to know who is going to get things done. You can trust in that. Flexibility. I am able to devote my time to my work with Medifast while also engaging in my careers. Medifast also has a university so you can apply yourself in house. Did I mention they feed you? They feed you.","There's a slight disconnect from the levels in the company with ELT. They are great at what they do, but you rarely have a second to engage with them. I say this for those who are looking to improve and advance their knowledge in the industry. I can't say the doors are not open as they have a mentoring program. However, I often find connections to the workforce are stronger when they are engaging outside of a program. If you do not like working behind the scenes, then you may not like the effort you are required to put in with Medifast. A lot of the work we do is accomplished behind the curtain. Yet, there are positions here that are hands on so, pick your season. There could be better options to invest in the company you are pouring into. That information is like out there in the universe. Bonus percentages could be divided more evenly. That's more personal than a con. They do pretty well here, actually. For the most part, you can grow, yet I have seen the ball get dropped a few times and that makes me question so ask about that in your interview.

As a middle aged adult switching careers I took a part-time position at my local meijer doing overnight stocking just for alittle additional income. I worked in retail long ago as a teenager and kept an open mind going in. In my 9 months of employment before voluntarily quitting, I was the second most senior stocker for my shifts. The turnover here is incredible due to work conditions. Most people don't last a month, some not even a few weeks. You will deal with constant micromanagement even if performing well. Don't expect a team environment, you will be assigned aisles with full pallets of cases that you have a set time to have completed by. Even after memorizing locations of products and not having to refer to location stickers, you would have to quite literally run to meet these times. Ultimately, the harder you work to meet arbitrary metrics will be met with increased amounts since you could achieve the prior goal. The pallets of cases will keep getting larger and you will have no incentive to continue to damage your mind and body to pad the numbers for your store.

But that isn't really a problem that the company can control. This was for the produce department at my particular store, which gets the biggest truck load every night. Raises are every 1000 hours you work and you are more likely to make more money getting hired in as a new employee than you are staying there and working the hours needed to get a 25-35 raise.

3. Japan HQ and Yokogawa Singapore are controlling too much and allocate too little fund for employees' salary. 
4. management are lack of innovative

7. Too little growth for engineers. No career path at all as all the old folks are still staying in the company. 
8. PAY really low. New engineers please dont even think of joining. 
9. Bad for interns, they just treating interns as free labour to do cheap and easy things 
10. Every year has more than TEN engineers resign. Forever looping the same situation and hire new and cheap engineers

1.0,Genuinely depressing workplace.,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Office is nice, hours are flexible, and sometimes working from home is available. Some colleagues are friendly and great to work with.","This place also used to be called “Rap International” The workplace is toxic, they provide 0 insight into the business, and provide no training on their systems, but then they expect you to become an active contributor to the team, then make you feel stupid if you haven’t done something in the most optimal way. I was told that it was my responsibility to train myself to their standards, even though my contract stated there would be a full training plan in place - brought this up 3 times and was told it didn’t even exist. The system itself was entirely outdated, and very un-organised, which is “the way it’s always been” and there’s no intent on making a change. The management was abysmal, constantly micromanaging, and have no trust in their staff. They also refuse to take any responsibility for anything, and constantly put the blame on you if you question anything. There were numerous occasions where I was spoken to in passive aggressive and sarcastic tones. They had 0 interest in building relationships with staff, other than a select few who seemed to be part of a clique(probably the only ones leaving good reviews). I, along with others were made to feel like outsiders, and were often disregarded. There were times where I went months without speaking to my supervisor, unless it was to be criticised for something, but when I asked for any support they were not interested and I was told to “look on Google”. Every time I attempted to make a suggestion to improve the workplace for everyone, or even for my own experience, I was shut down and my opinion was disregarded. The salary in this place is horrendous, and the performance reviews are ridiculous and are entirely opinion based (management’s opinion), they almost make it impossible to get a pay rise of any kind and I personally experienced unfair judgment in this matter. There’s a crazy staff turnover, people come and go every few months, most leaving within a year, and for good reason too. I would strongly advise you stay well away from this place, especially if you value your mental health.",,x,o,x,1,1,1,2,1.0,1.0,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Yokogawa-Reviews-E8192.htm,2023-04-04, Software Developer,

Furthermore, Pragma possesses extensive expertise in the end-to-end digital realm, making it a leading-edge company.","While Pragma has many strengths, there have been instances of manipulative and rude behavior among some managers.

Every chapter is different, and I know there has been significant restructuring there since 2020, but overall the org has a strong culture and generally good fundraising practices.","At the time of my departure, the organization was in the midst of major challenges due to the COVID pandemic, as many non-profits were. I think the greatest challenge for LLS was that it is a heavily event-based fundraising organization, leading to a bigger hit than orgs that rely more heavily on individual gifts and partnerships not based as heavily in event-based marketing. Granted, it's an organization that at one point was raising north of $300M annually, so I think they handled it to the best of their ability. There were at times lots of changes at the top level of the org - strategy shifts, moving to a regional structure then away from a regional structure and back, etc. That caused some challenges but overall I never felt like I worked in an unstable environment.",,v,r,v,5,4,4,5,5.0,5.0,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Leukemia-and-Lymphoma-Society-Reviews-E24863.htm,2023-06-15, Senior Development Director,

Expectations of YOY revenue growth by 20% with 3% or less salary increase annually that doesn’t match cost of living standards. Too much emphasis on following national campaign standards rather than overall outcomes and doing what works for each market and volunteers. Fake DEI initiatives to pretend they are working toward equity within the org when there are no measures of accountability or improvement. Less than 150 POC employees in a nearly 1000 person workforce, majority of patients served are also white. Outward facing materials and national representatives intentionally depict a higher level of diversity than in reality. Often hire people with little to no experience in the type of role they are in, sometimes even hiring college graduates who have never had a job before for mid-senior level management positions which puts a strain on others within the market team.

5.0,Fantastic Hiring Experience,"Current Employee, less than 1 year","I have worked in the bio/pharma industry for 18 years, and have been through many interviews and more than a couple hiring processes. This one by far was the best experience I have had. The top three areas that made this experience far superior to others were 1) ""high quality communication"" meaning that the ability of the hiring team to communicate expectations, coach, provide answers to questions, and ask questions in a respectful and thoughtful manner were far above the benchmark 2) willingness to allow the process to unfold naturally, rather than fitting it into a ""box"" meaning that instead of running candidates through fixed steps like a factory, they were willing to tailor the hiring process to my interests, needs, and availability 3) clear vision setting for the initial role as well as long term growth, meaning that the hiring team made it clear that hiring for long term growth was part of the goal for Waters. I have worked at six other companies, and none have been as organized, as focused, or as courteous throughout the hiring process. Of course, that is the ""show room"" so to speak. It remains to be seen what is under the hood.","No cons as of this moment, but all companies have weak areas.

2.0,It used to be a great place to work,"Former Employee, more than 10 years",Lots of opportunity for education when you first start. The ability to make lateral moves is nice.,Waters doesn't pay as competitively as similar companies or offer yearly bonuses but they used to make up for it by treating their employees well. Waters had a wonderful company culture that has suffered in the last 5 years under poor leadership. There were big missteps during Covid. They cut everyone's pay and put some employees on furlough anticipating a bad year but when they had a very normal year they didn't return any of the money. Instead we got to listen to them boast about the profits after taking money out of our pockets. Another major problem Waters has is leaving in poor middle managers. I have seen managers single handedly drive away a large group of employees in multiple departments and nothing is done about it. The attrition problems at Waters have gotten so bad in the last 5 years that it has chipped away at the in house knowledge severely. Lateral moves within the company become necessary because there are a lot of dead end career paths where your only opportunity for advancement is going into management.,,x,x,x,2,2,1,4,1.0,1.0,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Waters-Reviews-E5431.htm,2023-02-10, Anonymous Employee,

3.0,"Decent benefits, meh pay, overworked, understaffed, culture varies",Current Employee,"For a fast food/gas station job, the pay and benefits are not terrible. Most Columbus stores start at $15/hr except for Powell, Westerville, ans Polaris which start at $16. The health, vision, and dental are cheap and decent. I pay about $65 a paycheck for all of them. The worst one in my opinion is the vision insurance but only because the cost for glasses is not covered up front by the insurance and rather requires a reimbursment claim. If you land a good store, your coworkers will be cool but this is not a gurantee.","While I mentioned the pay isnt bad I think Sheetz needs to drop the ""competitive wages"" line or make it more clear that they mean competitive wages only for competitor businesses such as fast food and gas stations. I work right next to one store that starts at $17 an hour and within a walking distance of many businesses that pay the same or more for arguably less work. Many supervisors I have spoken to only stay because the benefits are better here or they are in a contract with the company. Sheetz claims to care about its employees but I disagree. They do not make it easy for people to give direct feedback or suggestions as employees. They donate to charities such as Autism Speaks as well which as someone with family members with autism puts a bad taste in my mouth. Their attendance policy I think is not great. It is a points based system and you will earn a certain amount of points depending on how early or late you call off, no show, or leave work early. Once you hit 33 they do a point review with HR. You can bring doctors notes but these will not automatically deduct points, those points will stay till the review and are not even guranteed to remove them at review. Managers are required to maintain 40 hours a week which means anytime they get sick, have car issues, etc they have to use PTO to cover this time which is a lot when the beginning balance for supervisors is only 120 hours. (Working 10 hour days). The treatment of nightshift workers is insane. Depending on your store the nightshift will likely be understaffed and overworked, often having the most tasks assigned to them while also making orders, again, usually understaffed. The other shifts often do not appreciate them and talk bad about overnight.",,x,r,r,3,3,2,2,2.0,4.0,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Sheetz-Reviews-E4015.htm,2023-04-06, Store Team Member,

The employees were mean and every person who was hired after me quit after their first overnight.

1.0,Not a good company to work for anymore,"Current Employee, more than 5 years",Flexible scheduling allows you to set your availability and be scheduled within that availability most times.,"Sheetz constantly reduces the hours my store is allowed to have but continues to expect us to get orders out in a timely manner, have the store clean, have the shelves stocked, and take crap from the customers for stuff that is out of our control. It is a constant struggle everyday to get anything accomplished as we can't schedule the help we need since corporate thinks it's a great idea to continue cutting hours. The turnover rate is extremely high as new employees hate working here and getting paid below average for the area. They can work at Walmart or McDonald's and make more than what they could make at Sheetz. We have constant callouts every day and typically work with an average of 3 people but a lot of times it's just 2 people running the entire store. With a kitchen full of orders and 1 or 2 employees we are expected to get out huge orders within 6 minutes and when we don't the customer's get very angry with us which is understandable cause they are waiting a long time but we simply don't have the hours to give to people to get the help we need and therefore can't possibly make orders any faster. No one at my store likes working there and it is a constant crap show. Sheetz boasts about their record breaking profits but in the same breath says they can't ""afford"" to help us. I think that is extremely disrespectful to boast record breaking profits and say they won't help us. We get paid too little and put up with too much crap. Sheetz was a great company to work for when I started 6 years ago. The last 3 years have been some of the worst experiences I've ever had to deal with. I used to be a supervisor on 3rd shift and only had 1 other person working which was extremely unsafe but unfortunately sheetz didn't care. You are not even allowed to close the store or even the kitchen if it's one person working cause they care about money too much. We are open 24/7 and it is mandatory to work every holiday which is really quite sad. At the bare minimum there is no reason for the kitchen to be open. I could continue on with the cons and what not but hopefully this is enough to deter anyone from working at Sheetz. It's truly sad how fast this place is going downhill.",,x,x,x,3,2,3,2,2.0,4.0,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Sheetz-Reviews-E4015.htm,2023-01-27, Retail Salesperson,

1.0,Horrible and immoral place to work,"Former Employee, less than 1 year",work from home and decent hourly,"I really regret taking this job. Everything starts out really nice and management is very supportive for the first two weeks or so, but everyone is very fake. Everyone is either a sheep and follows whatever they're told, a sociopath, or delusional. You are forced to ask for money from people who have already said that they are struggling financially, and that unless someone states they cannot afford to put food on the table, you still have to ask them for money. I spoke with management and they confirmed that even if someone says they are elderly and have no income, to still ask them for money. Other examples are we were told to ask for money from people who are undergoing surgeries, on maternity leave, etc. Management will only like you if you do whatever they want and don't ask any questions. The workplace is very unprofessional. You are only paid for time when you are logged in for calls, and calls are generally back to back. Only one 15 minute break per day is paid. I was called into management to discuss the fact that I was not harassing low-income, elderly, etc people for money after they told me they can't donate. I had to take my roommate to the hospital the same day, so was unable to get a second chance to fix what they were asking me to fix, as they decided to fire me the next day. This job has zero stability and I also initially saw 11 people enter training, and only four (including myself) lasted 2 weeks. You are not safe even if you make a good percentage of donations, because the second you disagree with them you will be terminated. This job has an incredibly high turnover rate, probably from people being fired on a whim or people realizing you have to be a terrible person to work here. The only reason people can possibly think they're being decent people is if they delude themselves into thinking the charity matters more than the wellbeing of the individual people being called. Don't work here unless you're in it for the experience/training or really, really need the money.",,x,x,x,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Reviews/Causeworx-Reviews-E936542.htm,2023-02-16, Telefundraiser,

At any cost, they don't want their big monolithic system to go down to avoid any business downtime. As a developer, we dont get any new tech or innovative projects excpet patch up work on that giant monolithic system and get ready to get into calls any time in 12hrs (two shifts one in India 12hrs and the other one from the USA 12hrs shift) . If you are kingd of person just want to do some routine patch up work and ready to get to calls in 12hrs a day including one of weekend. then its for you.","If you are someone looking to work on new tech/new project development on the cloud, then it's not for you. Don't be under impression that as it's being a product based, you get benefits like in the product-based company like opportunities to work on new tech stack and cloud architecture, etc. If you think, its cool to not work most of the time on the actual project but get into lengthy calls (10hrs or sometimes 24/48hrs) for production support twice in a week, then its for you. If you are looking to grow in your career by enhancing your real tech stack experience, then you have to think twice. Higher management never bothers to review manager-level activities, this leads a huge gap between the developer and the company's higher management and finally, your manager is your company. No one else out there to listen to your concerns. Manager make sure his comfort without bothering employees legar working hours, instead insists on getting onto production support calls for more than 12 hrs frequently.

I have worked at two warehouses both feel complety differnt for good and bad. Before applying go to the warehouse you want to work talk to staff get a feel of the vibe of that building. Since pandemic has been a ramp up in pressure selling from all departments which can lead to mental exhaustion. Depending on role sometimes it can be allot of chasing goals and numbers which adds stress. The path to moving up is there but again dependant on your warehosue culture many who I have spoken too, it seems to be a clique culture to move up rather than ability most of the time.

Sometimes the same thing happened with going to the bathroom--you weren't supposed to go too much or be gone too long and had to find coverage if you did. Also the job was standing all day without being allowed to sit down except on breaks.

It’s not realistically enough for most people to be able to make ends meet, in the area we’re living in. It might take some searching, but there’s better jobs out there that will pay enough to live. You should find those jobs, until Costco gets the memo to pay their warehouse workers better. Some of the people higher on the totem pole are very good at subtly manipulating and guilt tripping you if you bring up any concerns. They have a way of convincing you that you should be grateful for the table scraps you are given, and you’re being unreasonable for asking for anything more.

Since I took the job expecting to get a part-time salary, taking these shifts was the only way for me to support myself financially without finding a new job. - Management regularly called me at 2-4am on my days off to cover shifts as well. - Switching to a nocturnal work schedule put a lot of strain on my personal relationships because I consistently fell asleep right when my friends would get off work and want to hang out.

It is a super fast-paced environment, especially in Richmond since is one of the busiest branches in North America so you won't get bored. Colleagues and supervisors most of them are nice and friendly people, with just a few exceptions. You'll learn a lot about their operation. As cashier assistant (the person who packs members' groceries), you are part of the Front-End team, which means you will do different activities in addition to packing groceries. For instance, being a cashier in the regular and self-checkout tails (they will train you and pay you 1 extra CAD per hour), restocking items that were left over on the tails at the end of the day, helping in inventory counting twice a year, and working outside in the parking lot pushing the shopping carts, and anything else they need help.","It is really hard physical work, you have to stay on your feet all day long which is exhausting, pushing, and lifting heavy stuff. 30 min, lunch, and one or two additional 15-minute breaks (depending on how many hours is your shift). Once a week you must have a shift in the exterior pushing the shopping carts, if they train you you can use the machines to do so, but if not you'll have to push them manually and it's really heavy, also no matter whether conditions so you'll get soaked when it's rainy.

1.0,Culture of burning out employees,Current Employee,"I like the people within my department and people are generally very nice. Everyone understands what it’s like to work here, and having people who understand and share your frustrations helps.","There’s a culture of undervaluing employees, not supporting them, overloading them with work, and burning them out. Many people across departments are drowning, This specific word is always the one used within the office “I’m drowning right now”. Especially if supporting you comes with some sort of financial cost or require someone being hired because upper management often doesn’t want to spend the money. Again, this is across departments, though some departments are notably worse than others. 

They’ve never been careful about covid or put the health of their employees above having bodies in the office. We were required to come back July 2020, long before vaccines were made. Even after vaccines when there were waves of covid going around in 2021/2022, covid would rip through everyone at the office and there were no options for flexibility for anyone with health concerns. I think this speaks to how employees are seen how inflexible the wfh policy is. 

There’s a constant rotating door of new employees coming and leaving after a few months of employment. There’s no structure within the company. Because of this workflow and processes are consistently chaotic. Because of this, the day you start you’ll already be 3 months behind. This is pretty much an inside joke at the company, and it’s very true. 

If you are or were with a company that and flexible WFH schedule and are not sure about the companies strict 4 days in the office policy, think very carefully about how much being required to be in the office, as well as daily commute, will impact and take away from your work life balance. 

Also, don’t take employee longevity for satisfaction within their role or the company. Some people have been at the company for years and years yet have felt unhappy, demotivated, taken advantage of, and undervalued for years. But they have their own personal reasons for staying and do what they need to to cope. 

Also, if you’re applying for a job for a specific department and you’re not seeing reviews from that department here, it’s not because everything within that department is fine. They likely have these complaints and more, and their department is too small for them to feel like they can safely leave a review with their honest insights and feelings. Actually, their team is likely as small as it is because they’re not being given the financial resources and support they need, aka hiring additional team members. 

I will say, that while having a good manager will never negate the reality of the way the company is run, it can make your experience a smoother. A bad manager will make the burn out and mental toll significantly worse. 

In terms of what others have mentioned about the CEO, he comes for about a week every month and yes he makes employees during meetings cry. During that time you’re not allowed to have jackets or anything hanging on your chair, he’ll say something to you if you do. You’re not allowed to eat at your desk, he’ll throw out your food if you are and he’s there to see it. Your desk has to be very clean and organized. When people have been out of the office the week before he comes into town, they will come in during the weekends to clean up and organize their offices or desk areas. It’s unacceptable for your work area to be cluttered or messy while he’s there. If you think this is an exaggeration, you’ll find out quickly that it’s not. 

Work life balance is very hard. 

This company operates very differently from others, and you’ll both feel and experience many of these things when you start, as well as hear it talked about within your first few weeks.",,x,x,o,1,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,Reviews/Inter-Parfums-Reviews-E2108.htm,2023-03-31, Anonymous Employee,

They cheeped out recently on the paint and it doesn't match what has been used for years on the property requiring a lot more effort.  They didn't care.

 I have given up 5 years of my life to them and wont get any of that time back.   If you value your family and loved one's, do yourself a favor and do not work for any part of JRK. I promise, you will sorely regret it. There was ZERO work life balance. They have no one in place to cover employees for vacation or sick time. I spent over a solid year on call. If you wanted to take time off, you would have to work harder when you came back and still handle emergencies and take calls if you were on vacation. I gave up 170 hours of vacation time when I quit and now extremely happy that I am free. Of course they didn't pay out any of that time. They do not care about you. The company has extremely high turnover from the corporate level all the way down to most site's that they own. They find every way possible not to pay or pay extremely late employee commissions and also have lost many vendors from not paying them at all or always late over the years.  They hire anyone they can just to fill any role so that your immediate higher ups wont have the stress of hiring someone who is actually qualified for the position, then will terminate the position because the company wont spend any real time with training. JRK is now just a revolving door. Do yourself a favor and STAY AWAY!
