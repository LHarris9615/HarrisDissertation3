3.0,"Expect more AND less, means to an end","Former Employee, more than 1 year",Depending on the staff you will be working with some very talented individuals. You will learn a lot from your co workers even if you have worked in fine dining previously. Take full advantage of Forbes steps of service training & wine classes. Every day you are expected to bring the very best to your all guests(especially VIP). If you take pride in your work this can be a satisfying place to work. Benefits are available but be sure you are working over 50 hours a week including Sunday Brunch & holidays. Best part of the job was definitely my co workers and some favorite celebrities.,"The pay does not compensate for the long shifts and amount of work/talent expected. Not only must you work Sunday brunch to guarantee a decent paycheck but all tips are pooled (cash & credit) with cooks, floor valets, vehicle valets, front desk.

1.0,Neuromuscular Division Specific,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","KU Med has incredible benefits and continues to strive towards being better. It's clear this institution is heading in the right direction with generous sick leave, programs to donate sick leave to other employees, vacation leave is a separate pool, adequate maternity leave, etc.","Overall, the institution is great to work for but this varies from department to department. Therefore, I want to disclaim that this review is based solely on experiences with the Neuromuscular Division. I did not leave this position negatively (fired, etc.) and was even offered a raise during my time here, but would like to offer my honest opinion of my time within this team.

The Neuromuscular Division is lacking in organization and leadership leading to a dysfunctional environment with little to no training but high accountability. The training process if poorly structured and mostly 'learn as you go' - you are expected to perform near perfectly and will be met with strong criticism when mistakes are made. You will be told during interviews that ""mistakes happen and that's ok"" but will quickly learn this sentiment holds no weight. Very minimal praise is given and your accomplishments will go largely unnoticed. Many of the physicians are great to work with with exclusion to the team leader. He has fostered an environment of fear with his low tolerance of mistakes; discipline even being doled out in front of team members at meetings. There is an adopted method of 'bullying' employees into quitting and very high turnover in this department. An exit interview was requested, but was never granted. Overall, it seems the institution is allowing this destructive environment to continue within this department and thus the high turnover rate continues.

There are some people that really care about the welfare of their colleagues.","Zopa have completely lost their way. When I first joined I was excited to be part of such a vibrant, caring and determined company but that feeling faded over my first year. Bad decisions have been consistently taken, for example changing the tech stack completely - isolating many of the developers who made Zopa what it was. Most have now departed. 

Anything bank related take top priority, understandably, but is managed and led with such incompetence. Whilst other companies obtain bank licences with (seeming) ease, Zopa can't launch a single product needed to get theirs. Products, projects, ideas are constantly shelved and replaced with workarounds and stopgaps. Infrastructure is ready to collapse. The amount of manual process is farcical. 

It's luck of the draw in regards to whether you'll be looked after by zopa or not. If you draw the short straw, it can be a really tough place to work.  Managers are often looking to offload their pressure and shortcomings onto their direct reports and it happens all too often",,x,x,x,2.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,,Reviews/Zopa-Reviews-E1107358.htm,2019-12-11, Software Engineer,

- Pay in-line with comparable firms.","- Given the firm's start-up roots, there is a serious lack of organisation and structure around decision-making. As such, senior leadership often act autonomously, without consideration for either their own team, or others across the firm. The thought process behind these decisions are then, more often than not, not explained to staff, leaving them confused and disenfranchised.
- Existing staff, despite having had multiple interviews to make an internal transfer, have suddenly been told that the company is now under a 'hiring freeze', despite job adverts since being advertised online.

I was asked to leave with immediate effect couldn’t collect my things myself or go back upstairs. I felt like I was being treated like some sort of criminal.

The CEO is a nice guy that is doing a good job in transforming the company into a bank.,"The .NET stack has been neglected in favour of Java/Kotlin rewrites of most services. As a result, several .NET devs have left over the last 12 months. This leaves Zopa in a vulnerable position because the core of the P2P business still runs on .NET. I suspect that the remaining few .NET devs will also checkout over the coming months, as better opportunities are available in London.

P2P investors/lenders have seen little improvement to the slow user experience and confusing dashboard. This is due to an ongoing controversial rewrite of the investor platform which shows no sign of being complete any time soon.

You're originally told you can choose your hours, but then managers harass you to be there 8am-8pm and weekends. They promote work/life balance as a benefit, but it's a complete misconception.

They don't disclose that it will take several months to make any money at all, so you need to have a fantastic savings or someone else to support you.

You pay $100 per month for the ""company provided leads."" You have to make 400 dials a day on average to make a sale, and most the leads are angry people who are sick of their phone being blown up. You better be able to handle being screamed and cussed at!

You’d be putting regular people without chemical knowledge in very dangerous settings. I hope you stick to hiring people who have science degrees).  It really sucks that they took the engineer title away from women. 
Women! The company still actively employs more male FSE’s than female. Get ready for male engineer personalities that make you prove you can do the job.  Also get ready to be applauded for being an engineer when walking into work or up to clients. Apparently they think it’s the lack of applicants keeping them from having a gender balanced work place.

You and everyone else are trying to reach HQ over the radio but the radio is sparking and you never know the next time you will get shocked so you try the phone. When you try the phone it buzzes in you ear and you dial HQ but you only get a voice mail box. You continuously take incoming fire from your enemies that you can see closing in. Your company get called in by your CO and he tells you that the enemy is loosing ground and are about to surrender because of your hard work and dedication. Someone asks the CO about the new plane with the photon torpedoes, to which he replies that they are not a threat. You ask about the old radios and when they will be replaced and he does not recognize the name, model or function.
Everyone around you is frustrated because all they want to do is win. All the employees go to chow and talk about the burning desire down to their  bones to win the war. You try to strategize new ways of working with the old broken equipment to keep trying to make and support the same old equipment that has not been updated in years.

• Room for promotion
• Well managed aside from some personal gripes","• Shifts could be incredibly stressful. Night shifts in particular can be incredibly hellish as the store I was working for would only have three people working until 5am when the morning rush began at 4am. 

• Expect regular call offs that can occasionally go uncovered.

• Need to have full availability to get the hours you want unless you ""claim"" a shift as some employees were able to do. Once you do get those hours expect to be juggled across multiple shifts throughout the week. Part of me wants to chalk it up to the difficulties of scheduling, but I suspect that it could have been done in a way that better respects employees' health.

• Also expect to work every holiday. Not only that, expect at least one of your coworkers to call off on the big holidays and you will absolutely be called in to cover their shift. You can expect a bigger paycheck, though so whether or not this is a pro or a con is entirely subjective.

If you are looking for a competent, full service med device development firm, this company is worthy of serious consideration.

Having had worked at Ximedica for several years, I can tell you (subjectively) that management has always treated clients and employees with respect and tried to do what is best.... now that doesn’t mean that everything is perfect but it does mean that there is a genuine effort to be fair, reasonable, treat clients and employees with respect, and do what’s right (even when it is not easy). The people (management and individual resources) at Ximedica really do enjoy their work and strive to be trusted advisors to clients. My experience is that the company is full of people who want to succeed. Really great people, great drive, genuine personalities, fun environment, plenty of drive and technical excellence.","The medical device development process is not an easy one. Proper development of any medical device takes time and a considerable amount of funding, and as a result the process can be frustrating for both client and consultant.... the process is often filled with peeks and valleys. Although Ximedica utilizes their depth of experience and expertise to plan and resource projects, Ximedica cannot predict every twist and turn that may arise and as a result schedules and budgets are impacted... this is difficult and stressful for everyone.

There have been instances where resources were spread too thin and I’m sure that there have been/are instances where employees should be compensated better.

How many ADT  and how many Liberty Mutual that you need to sell daily/weekly or monthly.

The pay and compensation structure is absolutely horrendous and you are always being nickel and dimed your pay. Dissatisfied employees and the mood has changed significantly since I've been here leading to high turnover. Any person with selling experience DO NOT PERSUE, for your own good. This should only be a very basic entry level job if that. 

We are forced to sell a dream and the service is constantly changing where the customer always seems confused. You're basically trying to squeeze out pennies from most of your potential customers that end up getting mad and cancelling the service right away. No accountability from the company results in the sellers losing any kind of commission from the sale. At this point it's almost laughable. 

The higher ups are always promising that a better product is coming with no follow through. High expectations with an unrealistic strategy.

1.0,Career Growth? Look Elsewhere.,"Former Employee, more than 3 years","By far Porch hired some of Seattle’s top talent. Not just top talent, but genuinely amazing people. I will be calling many from Porch friends for life. For that I am forever grateful. 

I write this review for those that are left (most have already gone) as you deserve better, and better is out there.","The recent review stating the CEO needs an executive coach couldn’t be more accurate.  I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt as there is no doubt he’s under stress with the current trajectory of the company, but he was the iceberg that struck the Titanic. Additionally, I’ve unfortunately seen him go through 3 EA’s during my time - each one I’ve repeatedly heard he has berated and made cry on multiple occasions. We get it, you’re stressed but taking it out on your team and not hiring real HR to clean up the toxic culture you allow is shady (and most of your employees think you’re an anti-social jerk).

The same can be said for *most* of the leadership team, which happens to be the water that is sinking the ship. Minimal transparency and lack of real care for the underpaid individuals who work their tails off to keep the place running. There are some great mangers, but they have no support to make things right and are doing their job with both hands tied behind their back. The 3+ years I worked at Porch was a continual revolving door with multiple stressful layoffs and people jumping ship. 

As much as I love some of the sales team members, the culture is like watching reruns of “Workaholics”. Caffeine pill bottles, frequent vape breaks, put-put golf down every aisle and bad EDM/Rap music playing loudly ALL DAY LONG so all prospects and customers can undoubtedly hear. In their defense, it may be necessary to sell the product (the product is a mess in case you were wondering).

Long story short - if you want a career, competitive (respectable) pay, purpose in your role and mentorship, I would recommend taking full advantage of Seattle’s booming job market and avoid Porch. 

Leaving was bittersweet due to the amazing people I worked with, but getting out of those old brick walls showed me the INCREDIBLE opportunities that are out there. Porch taught me I deserve better.

2.0,Would not recommend,"Former Employee, less than 1 year",The largest pros of working at Artsmarketing were free tickets that were compliments of the non-profit we were contracted under.  I had an issue with another coworker and it was thankfully addressed quickly.,"Extremely unprofessional office environment. Our manager constantly complained to us about how little money she was making. It was very difficult to keep callers as the pay begins at minimum wage. McDonald's will start you at higher than minimum wage. It is not enough to make the calls that are in queue, one is required to maintain a certain amount of sales or they will be terminated, which is also not conducive to keeping a full office. This is particularly disheartening during times of low or no contact - callers shouldn't be held responsible for not making sales when no one is answering the phone. Callers who do not make the required amount of sales are then not eligible to work extra hours that would then allow them to perhaps garner more contact. I found it to be an extremely shoddy and inefficient system, since callers were always being asked to refer friends to keep a full office - there's no way I would ask a friend to work somewhere that only paid minimum wage plus a very small commission. A caller's wage increases as their sales increase - however, the manager once raised my pay based on my sales and then Artsmarketing dropped it, stating that the manager had mistakenly calculated the sales. Dropping wages without notification before the employee begins at the dropped rate is illegal. We also were highly involved in a fundraising campaign and were not told that we had met goal when the fundraising goal was met.

I understand that most higher positions are applied in house (Need at least one year experience with Costco) but as someone who has supervisor experience, I'm denied an opportunity. In my mind, it shouldn't be hard to train a new supervisor and teach them Costco values and ethics coming from another employer.  Lack of communication between supervisors, breaks go out from 30-60 minutes late, throwing production off when staff of around 30-40 are waiting. I typically worked outside pushing carts, which I'm fine with but when we are told rules such as ""Don't wear your hoods while it rains"" because our manager would rather us get wet than get hit by traffic. I understand that but it came across as an insult to my intelligence. I can't fully turn my head side to side when crossing?

1.0,very poor direction and management,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",The work is often steady.,"I worked as a Front End Assistant at the Burnsville warehouse of Costco Wholesale Corporation for about a year-and-a-half.  I am writing this review because I feel a duty to prospective employees of the Costco Burnsville warehouse and the fine co-workers I met while working at the warehouse.  I recommend not working at Costco Burnsville.  

Costco Burnsville is poorly managed.  From the first day, working at Costco felt like a prison.  A network of surveillance cameras and supervisors micromanage every move employees make.  Management does not know how to respect employees, which they treat as disposable.  Good employees are not promoted.  Good employees do not receive training to advance.  The turnover rate for employees Costco Burnsville is very high.  After the warehouse closes in the evening, employees are required to have a supervisor let them leave the building.  

The work as a Front End Assistant at Costco Burnsville is grueling.  I worked in -30 degree and 100+ degree Fahrenheit weather pushing carts for entire shifts at a time, often over the course of multiple days.  The Costco Burnsville warehouse has many injuries suffered by employees.  The 4.5 hour shifts are almost not worth the commute.

6.) Corporate Leaders are actually likeable. I met the CEO a few months ago alongside some of his comrades and genuinely liked the experience.

4.) Don't ever skimp out on remembering certain commandments, quality commandments, and certain policies. You will regret it. Not really a con, but there's a lot to remember.

1.0,Costco IS (IT) is not a good place to work at all.  Don't do it!,"Former Employee, less than 1 year","-Cheap food at the corporate cafeteria.  This may be a negative if you are trying to lose weight, as many, many employees typically gain a lot of weight after starting to work at corporate.  People I worked with called it the Costco 40.
-Cheap benefits compared to most companies.
-No real accountability so you can basically come in and do nothing all day if you want.  This is a huge con though if you want to actually get work done since there is a lot of dead weight.","-Management doesn't really care about you, and doesn't listen to feedback at all.  We had an employee survey that, after many promises, was never given serious consideration by management.  After repeatedly saying they would release the results, it was swept under the rug and no official response ever came out of it.  The main response was to hire a different survey company, who released results that Costco IS had the worst results of any company they had ever surveyed.  I also found internal documentation showing that management had paid for cultural consultants to come in years ago for an assessment.  The consultants summarized all of the issues perfectly and management chose to ignore all of their feedback.  Costco management has a culture of doing whatever they want at the expense of their employees.  Costco management as a whole also has a reputation of being a good-old-boys club.  Just Google ""costco management sexism"" if you don't believe me.  Management is filled with suck-ups who really don't care about you, and only want you to fall in line.
-Management is for the most part not technical at all, and this really hurts the IT organization.  It wasn't uncommon for management to transfer from the warehouse to IT.  The running joke was that we had bakery managers running things.
-Costco IS has a culture of awarding tenure over ability.  They don't care if you work hard or not.  All that matters is how many years you've worn a Costco badge.  This is reflected in the parking, vacation, 401k and other policies which reward people who have worked there the longest.  It doesn't matter if you have 15 years of experience prior to working at Costco.  You won't be taken seriously unless you've been there a really long time.  Speaking of vacation, it is totally non-negotiable.  You start with 2 weeks of vacation up until 5 years.  The 401k is the poorest of any that I've ever personally seen with a maximum $500 match for the first year.  They basically treat you like a warehouse worker even if you work in Corporate IT.
-Parking absolutely sucks.  They have an insane reserved parking spot system that rewards employees who have been there 15+ years.  At one point it was so bad if you weren't at work before 7AM you weren't getting a parking spot and would have to shuttle over.
-There is a real lack of accountability.  It doesn't matter if you only work 5 hours a day, as long as you are able to man a chair for core hours, you will be receiving a paycheck.  I saw people cause multi-million dollar outages through negligence and they were not punished.  I never saw anyone getting fired for anything and it was really bad.
-Working from home is strictly prohibited, unless you are a contractor.  They repeatedly wouldn't allow us to work from home, but at the same time they were willing to allow it for contractors.  This felt like regular employees were being punished while contractors were being rewarded.
-The on-call rotation was the worst I've ever been a part of in 15 years.  When you are on-call expect to be paged at all hours of the night.  You won't be able to have a normal weekend because you will be repeatedly paged for the dumbest reasons.
-Technical debt is a huge issue at Costco IS.  If you're big on 1990s IT concepts this is your place.  Things like the cloud were in their infancy and were already being misused at Costco.  There was no serious planning, and no vision by anyone in the IT department with any real power.
-The pay and benefits were very poor for the Seattle area.  This really needs to be addressed because they will have issues recruiting and keeping the quality employees they are going to need to modernize Costco IS.
-The Costco IS office space really sucks.  My team was in a huge 2 story building that is an extremely large open space.  The cubical walls are only about 3 feet tall and people's voices carried for miles.  If you were trying to get any serious work done, you would basically be required to buy expensive noise cancelling headphones.  The building also featured totally inadequate parking.  At one point people parked across the painted line and got towed.  It wasn't a good place to go to every day at all.  It also smelled like mold in that building, and I wouldn't be surprised if there were some serious problems with it.",,x,x,x,1,1,1,3,1.0,,Reviews/Costco-Wholesale-Reviews-E2590.htm,2019-01-14, Linux Systems Engineer,

They have you pushing carts outside in the wind, snow, freezing rain etc, for 2 hours in a stretch (if they forget to call you back in, expect to be there for 3 hours in a stretch. Not cool, Costco! You'll be helping the cashiers put things in Members shopping carts. Don't expect much help from the Members to unload their carts filled to a brim, because they'll just leave them there and wait for you to do it. Then they'll ask for everything to be put in boxes, and it has to be done a certain way and the boxes have to be custom made or to their liking if you don't want to be insulted and called a useless worker. You'll also have to go fetch them items that they either realized they forget to grab, or they just decide in the last minute that they don't want some perishable items that you have to run all across the end of the store to put back. A lot of times, Members don't read the price signs, so they don't know that some items come in pair otherwise the cashier can't sell them. That's when you go fetch them the other item because they tell you flat out that they don't feel like going back on the other side of the store to get them. You'll do lots of fetching and returning perishable items, whilst trying to box their groceries. If you're a closer, like I always was, they'll have you clean the entire register area, ie; sweeping and moping floors, empty garbage etc, all on your own, with no help. Then they'll tell you to hurry because you have to help out on the floor (they call it boxing). Be aware that no matter what your age is, your body will hurt constantly. I've had many sleepless nights because of the way they abuse their seasonal workers. You'll also have to be part of their clique for them to like you and/or consider you for a part time or full time position. Where I worked, there were a lot of Hispanics, and believe me, they didn't like anyone else. It was pure hell for me as a white woman to do my job because most of the cashiers were Hispanic, and they made my working life at Costco a living hell. I felt like I had stepped to a different dimension/realm. I left before my time there was up, as many before me did. I could cope with the hard, physical job, I just couldn't handle being insulted and put down just because I'm not Hispanic. The managers/supervisors are not nice, to say the least. They don't seem too happy to work there. I'm guessing they just stick it up for the money and great benefits.

2.0,Backlash is inventive,Current Employee,This company has great benefits and culture.... that’s it,"Training to all levels of management is fearsome, to lower management beyond fearsome. These guys need serious help on all accounts of equality. I work in the depot in Dallas and I have to say that these guy have 0 time management skills. Be prepared to suffer, because this job is not about work ethic at all, it is 100% a popularity contest. You will not get anywhere if you work hard in this company they will keep you on the ground. Best bet stay back do your time and just talk to people until your told to work. Instead of being proactive. They reward laziness and punish hard work.

Messed up, even if you are unsafe, a lot of people here get on their phones while they are on EPJ’s and forklift even while driving on in lanes. This has been brought to multiple levels of management and no one has said anything to the people who do this. This is completely unsafe, to do this on any equipment especially where you already have bare minimum of line of sight. If you wanted to move up in this company and you are a hard worker and one of your strengths is work ethic and integrity. Then I would strongly suggest stay away or leave the company. They treat those work ethic like pack mules and servants and treat lazy Individuals  like masters. The true people who run this company are lazy people not the CEO, the CEO should see how their employees are truly treated the ones who care about the deadlines and work hard to finish all their work. Instead of the mentality of “let’s make this work last all day so we can get all of our hours and maybe have roll over so we have more work for tomorrow. “ that statement has been said by some supervisor here and a lot of employees. Those who work hard and want to get their job done are ostracized by their fellow employees and management, for working hard, and are forced to work even harder to pick up the slack.",,x,r,x,1,4,1,1,5.0,,Reviews/Costco-Wholesale-Reviews-E2590.htm,2019-04-22, Anonymous Employee,
2.0,"Cashier Assistant: packing groceries, running errands, pushing carts, stocking, blocking down,","Former Employee, more than 1 year",Most employees not in management are awesome to work with. The pay is probably the best part with guaranteed hours plus benefits. Always busy so time usually flies. Two breaks & a paid 30 minute lunch for an 8 hour shift. Shifts vary for part timers 4-8 hours. They are very much about a “sense of urgency” which basically means the job is your daily workout.,"Lots of challenges. Always stressed, always under pressure, & highly criticized by members/management. The worst part is the management, & how they choose to run the business. They make a handbook & all these fancy 10 page long policies just to pick & choose when they want to follow them. So if you’re not a favorite you’ll get the handbook punishment, if you are favorited, you get an undocumented talk from a manager saying to correct an action. They are horrible at prioritizing. They break rules all the time, set horrible examples for leaders, yet expect lower employees to always do the right thing & not make mistakes. If you’re the kind of person to wear your emotions on your sleeve from things going on in your personal life, expect a conversation from a higher up telling you to essentially be a robot. They tell you they need you to get over it & overbear you with saying it’s not okay to feel that way at work because the members are more important & we don’t want to rub them wrong or ruin their shopping experience. Write ups are the literal definition of nonsense. One manager will tell you it’s okay to do X & then you get a write up a week later for doing said X. Communication is expected from lower workers, they ambush you with “you need to tell your higher up everything you do every time you do something”, yet the managers never communicate. You get frowned upon for not using the restroom on your breaks or lunches, especially within 30 minutes of taking them. When I was first hired everything I did was done the wrong way. I had one manager tell me how to do something & then the next manager I’d work with said that was wrong & showed me how to do it “correctly”. That is literally with everything, & every manager tells you how to do a task differently. It is stressful. The members are also extremely entitled, you’re expected to wipe the corners of their mouth after a meal. It is soul crushing. You just have to stand there smiling & eat it. Otherwise you get a write up for explaining the policies of the business, that you can’t allow them to break the rules because they “do it all the time”. So if you tell them they can’t do something you get in trouble, if you allow it you get in trouble. No winning. There are definitely cliques, a handful of employees are nothing but bored workers who create major drama. There are a ton of negatives, because I like to enjoy my work environment. Granted I know you get a fair share anywhere you go, but this place is overall exhausting. You can never win, even if you know you were in the right, it doesn’t matter to them. It wasn’t right enough, or that was good, but “do this instead next time”. They let the members walk all over you, & some employees. Like I said they pick & choose. It’s exhausting, frustrating, & stressful. You get guaranteed hours, but it gets stressful if you pay bills. One week/pay period you’ll work minimum 24 hours, the next almost 40. There was a span of 4 months that I got no more than 24 hours a week. That’s a 600 dollar check. When you work a ton of hours you can get up to 900+. If you were to apply, I would highly recommend to go to any department other than the front end. Every other department seems to run smoothly, front end is under a microscope. Managers always watching & picking your work ethic apart. As you can tell from my super long list of cons, it is a job that isn’t a joke, but also is. Major pros with major cons. The pay can be worth it at times, but all of the stress makes you dream of quitting. Main issue is management, if you can handle the rude, entitled members, that’s one thing, but the higher end is corrupt.",,x,r,x,3,5,1,1,3.0,,Reviews/Costco-Wholesale-Reviews-E2590.htm,2019-09-03, Cashier Assistant,

Time and a half on Sundays.,"I was supposed to be a wrapper yet I’m lifting at least 50 boxes of 50-80 pound boxes of frozen dough repeatedly throughout the day to put onto trays. They hired two men to be wrappers yet make the women do all the heavy lifting with pallets and stocking frozen dough into the freezer while playing Tetris with all the rusty racks in the way. They expect to change a schedule the day before and it be okay. No breaks. Huge language barrier when you don’t speak Spanish. Spanish music playing loudly all morning until the store opens. Being snapped at to work faster. Older employees being mean to us seasonal employees like we did something wrong, they just stare at us and talk when we walk away. Bakery is so loud, when people talk it sounds like whispers so you have to yell. People who’ve been there for 20 years expect you to remember everything by your second shift. I’ve already sprained my knee, my foot is swollen, and my wrist is swollen. The heavy lifting is always done by the tiny women while the men get to carry around plastic trays. I used to want to work here forever and now I dread going into work. I can’t wait until the season ends the first week of January. When they hire you they tell you, “we all started as seasonal so just work really hard and be in the top 10 and you might get hired on permanently” typical manager talk to get you to work your butt off for the season. Some of the managers are really really nice and genuine, others seem bitter. They are usually only hiring in the bakery as they said the turnover rate is so high, people always quit their first month. Two people who got hired with me quit their first day.

Dead weight

Parking - have seen people recently resorting to buying scooters to get from the parking garage to the IS buildings. Scooters! Honestly I don’t blame them that’s a long walk and the shuttles are slow. 

Slow shuttles. If you have to park at the main garage, be prepared to wait for the shuttle then wait as you stop at other buildings and going through Issaquah traffic. And if you have a manager that demands you work your “shift” be prepared to have to figure in your commute time not just from your house but also the commute from the main campus so you be on time for your “shift”. 

Food is cheap(er) but not that good. Even the coffee in the deli isn’t free. Never worked for a place that didn’t even give their employees free coffee. 

Seems like most people don’t care about their jobs. The probably had no experience doing what they are doing, just trained on the job. Here, read this “job-aid”... Never managed Active Directory? No problem!

A lot of former “cart pushers” in IS that don’t know anything other than “Costco IT”. (Which is usually the wrong way to do it). Others that now that they are out of the warehouse and at corporate are just on “cruise control” (do as little as possible, watch YouTube, go shopping at Best Buy, etc) until retirement. 

The good people all leave because they can’t enact change

No work from home AT ALL.  - this is especially frustrating because considering what they pay tech workers you can’t afford to live anywhere near 

No incentive. I’m a top performer but why should I even try? The difference in yearly raise is 1% between myself and the guy who falls asleep at his desk every afternoon

No accountability. You can literally cause a mistake that results in millions of dollars in lost profit/sales and nothing happens. 

Holiday vacation blackouts - this is the dumbest thing for IS. There is a change freeze during this time anyways. This is the PERFECT time for IS to be able to take vacation. 

Issaquah - traffic is so bad. Most of this is Costco corporate employees. Since you can’t work from home it only makes the issue worse. Also if you work in IS you have to work out of the Issaquah office. Nowhere else. Mind you that you can’t afford to live anywhere close.

Costco takes a kick back of the 401k fees but will not disclose how much. 401k fees are high.  Vacation time is only 2 weeks for first five years. However management gives some new hires more vacation time, a totally undocumented and unfair practice. Base benefits are not applied to all employees equally. There are no stock awards or ESPP. There are no bonuses. The work space consists of low cubicle walls with 4-6 people squished into a cube. There is no place to park, unless you have been here 20 years then you are gifted a reserved space. Telecommuting is not permitted. Promotions are based on who you know not qualifications. If you did not work on the business side or been here long enough to fail upward,  it's almost impossible to get into management. It's a sexist environment, which management seems clueless about. Complaints about this go nowhere. The opinions of  vendors or consultants are taken over the  skilled IT employees.

They made me sign a confidentiality agreement so I can’t say much except an employee who works all around the store started making very inappropriate and creepy comments that made me worry for my safety. I new I had to report it to management. After 3 weeks of “investigating” the solution was that they told him he wasn’t allowed to talk to me anymore and I  was just supposed to accept that. I brought up being transferred to a different store and they told me that would mean they failed and couldn’t have that. By the end I felt like I had nothing to work towards there. My only option was to trust that because they had spoken to the man who threatened me I should feel safe. I didn’t. My last day I went into the lunch room and the man was there. I was going to eat lunch in my car but I couldn’t bring myself to come back to work. I called the management to let them know. They said someone would follow up with me.

You will get fired for doing your job. They lie to you about commissions and bonuses. Sometimes they will clean house and fire everyone all in one day. They bring ‘floaters’ to ‘clean’ everything up. They will hire ANYONE! People with no driver licenses, no experience, and they do not train! Everyone talks about everyone’s business. If you are sick or injured, they will fire you. Imagine an owner that makes you hide all your maintence staff when he is on property.  They make you rent 10 apartments each week or you will get written up. If there are bad reviews on google, you will get written up. They make you work after hours and don’t pay you. They don’t follow any rules or guidelines. You will never take a full lunch. Don’t bother bringing anything up to HR, you will get fired for doing so. If you show up to work and try your best, they will fire you versus someone that comes drunk everyday and is sick every week. I’ve had 5 different managers in the two years I’ve been there. If you want to get fired, work for JRK! This is the worst company in history. I’m surprised they are still here. The 5 star reviews about anything JRK is completely fabricated. All lies! They treat floaters that have been there for years like crap! Once you start seeing floaters come. RUN! They are robots. There were maintenance techs selling drugs to long time Regional maintenance Supervisors. I saw sexual harassment on a daily basis. Discrimination and lots of inappropriate comments made by Regionals. They give you a heads up when someone gets fired so you can watch and pretend that you didn’t know.

1.0,Run far away from this company,Former Employee,Can’t think of any sadly,"If you are looking to get into the industry, this company is the last option you want to choose. They offer no training or support, so if you’re new to the industry, good luck. They DO NOT pay their vendors back. We had apartments with multiple roof leaks that couldn’t get fixed because they didn’t pay our vendor and they refused to complete the work. They choose the laziest and cheapest company for pest control so there were multiple apartments (including our model apartment) that often had roaches. 

The insurance that the company provides for employees is a joke. You can tell that JRK doesn’t put ANY money towards it because there is no reason why it should be well over $100 for single person w/ no kids for BASIC health insurance. 

I never saw a dime of commission during my time here. The managers were so slack and lazy and simply didn’t want to be bothered with the paperwork. And don’t buy anything for this company on your dime because you will not see it reimbursed for MONTHS.

Residents pretty much hated living at the property and always complained that there are always new people in the office.

There are so many more instances that i can bring up that show how horrible this company is. Not making apartments ready for move in, not paying vendors, etc. It’s sad that the way this company does business. You have beautiful properties with a lot of potential and amazing employees, yet it is clear that they are more focused on profits that actually keeping residents and their employees happy.

I have had a steady stream of work that both challenges me and interests me. Occasionally I get frustrated due to ""moving targets"" with projects, but that is usually out of the hands of our PMs. I feel like any job is what you make of it and CDM Smith in no exception. Reading some of the other reviews about micromanagement and no work-life balance... nobody can force you to work over-time, so if you don't want to, then don't. CDM Smith does not hold you back if you want to work over-time though, if you want more hours/pay they won't bat an eye. As for the PTO, you don't get any right when you get hired but accumulation seems pretty good, and your benefits start immediately, which saved my life. Three months into me working here I became extremely ill and racked up a hefty ER bill. Because my benefits were already activated, I only had to pay $150 out of pocket, which is amazing. I also am currently undergoing immunotherapy, which can be extremely expensive if not covered well or at all, and I haven't had to pay anything but 2 copays. They allow us all to work remotely if we want/need to, all we have to do is give our managers a little heads up. I've never had issues with just a day or even day-of notice of needing to go work from home. As someone previously mentioned they have access to a plethora of training, including training on ESRI software, which is what I use everyday, and at no cost. Overall, I've had a positive experience here so far.","Sometimes the annual raises can be a bit slim. I worked immensely hard my first year and was juggling three very large and long-term projects when I was originally hired to only handle one type of project for two years, and I only saw a 2% raise that year due to HR rules.
